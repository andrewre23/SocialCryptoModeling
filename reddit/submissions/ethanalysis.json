Going under $100 may seem unlikely now, but I would rather risk catching low buys vs buying in now than suffering a loss where $200 seems to be a hard point to pass with BTC dragging us down and we go below where we are now.\n\nMy guess, we try to retest the $200 psychological barrier and then get dragged back down as Bitcoin uncertainty fucks the rally and newbies and longs panic while shorters have a boner to for another drop.\n\nAlso, not including hobby miners, now would be a good time to sell IMO before the rush starts. I keep seeing the amount of GPU's popping up on the market increasing. You can turn a nice fat profit now with your beat up GPU's, take that cash and then invest it straight into ETH. Since the difficulty keeps climbing, the profit generated from mining will diminish in terms of ETH received. If you are in it for the money, I really don't see why investing in ETH directly would be less profitable than earning less and less ETH. Thats if you only mine ETH. Switching to another coin wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\nAnother thing, why the hell is Zcash mining so damn popular? Most coins start with few miners earning a ton of that coin and then the value goes up a ridiculous amount and the difficulty rises. With Zcash, the price is starting inflated and the difficulty keeps rising. Looking at the marketcap and assuming it doesn't pass BTC, it doesn't have much room to do a 10000% profit. Blows my mind how the Zcash hype is massive while everyone is diillusional that it would be a great mining coin. Even shitcoins are better to mine as they pump and you can dump. Lets say ETH went PoS. With Zcash so popular, the difficulty would explode as a lot of uneducated miners would switch to Zcash as it is so popular. I mean cmon, the founder of Zcash is working with Ethereum to help ETH with zK-snarks. IF ETH gets zK-snarks and is used as a currency (Which is isnt SUPPOSED to be but is a currency when people use ETH for purchases), there is literally no reason for Zcash.

They can do that when they actually only sell big, when ETH goes to the certain point, where TA allows it as a higher support line on the downtrend, causing more people to short at that point, as the TA is clearly showing the channel ETH has gone to in the bear market.

Good stuff with one crypto lifts all boats.  Anything negative on ANY MAJOR one will cause questions for the rest and probably cause the whole sector to dump as well.  Bitcoin will continue to lose dominance in the whole crypto sector because there is far too much money splashing around in a vastly huge space (what 600+ coins now?).  It is inevitable that bitcoin won't just lose 50% of market or 25% but you can bet that it will still hold a significant fraction of the market and won't go away entirely simply because it is first mover.  Only caveat: this won't happen if coin can still be moved in some market.  Any coin that can't transfer or trade by definition will die quickly.  There are too many ways people can obtain Bitcoin that DO NOT require the transaction to be on the blockchain AND THIS IS GOOD.   In fact I think this is one massively underestimated value feature for cryptocurrencies - the off chain trading markets that are growing faster than the on chain transactions right now.  And yet another reason to take profits when they make sense for investors/traders etc.   I agree with others that the ETH move here (in fact the entire sector except Bitcoin imo) is moving far too fast for any underlying economic basis.   But I would also agree that we are far too early in this sector 10x in BTC and ETH are real possibilities over next 5-10 years.  Hell could be as soon as this year or next given the move.   Expect hard and fast pull backs but I believe they all are buying opportunities.   So don't get so negative on Bitcoin.

Sometimes 15m just for fun or to time an entry/exit.\n\n**MACD derivative:** Yeah, just eyeballing and calculating in my head. If you look, they are often quite smooth. I've never heard of anyone using the derivative of the MACD but I've benefited from it quite a lot. I do, however, combine it with the general trend and the MACD on other time scales.\n\nFor instance: An hour ago, or so, when I opened my first short (I've doubled down twice since), my rationale was the following:\n\n* 2h, 1h, and 30m RSI are overbought and it looks like the top will be lower than the previous. A sign that the bull is running out of steam for now, so limited risk of a sudden break upwards.\n\n* The 2h MACD positive but on its way down (negative derivative). The 1h MACD was neutral with little movements. The 30m MACD was slowing down (negative double derivative) and looked be topping out, assuming it would be smooth.\n\n* Based on the above, I concluded that upwards momentum is running out of steam and therefore it would be improbable for us to break the latest top, hence we would start forming a possible double top.\n\n* The general trend right now is upwards and it looks like we broke out of the bear trend on volume yesterday. Therefore, I do not think we'll complete the double top (break ~\u20ac185/$210).\n\n* The above let me to conclude that on the short term there is a larger probability of us dropping than rising, thus I want to be short.\n\nEdit: Hope it is of some use :) Please note that nothing can stand alone and always be aware if the behavior changes. During one of the first major drops of this bear trend, I got out of shorts and in longs more or less on the bottom, because the MACD patterns deviated from previous patterns. Probably, mostly a lucky catch but damn, I'd rather exit a position at neutral or minor loss if the patterns don't play out as expected than exiting with a large loss due to stubbornness!\n\nEdit2: I actually just closed the shorts. Looks like we've bottomed out for now and as described, we're currently going upwards, so even neutral moment short time frames would push us upwards (at least that's how I interpret it).

The pennant's price target should be around 325 USD / 290 EUR, though i would probably sell around 300 USD just to see how we fare with that resistance line. If we break it, i will buyback with a sell-target of 290 EUR / 325 USD. \n\nAll in all, i traded this whole 'recovery' very cautiously. Still made a decent profit (half of the potential profit i could have made if i bought the bottom around 200 EUR and held) but this approach gave me a great peace of mind.

This is my take, but I'm wrong a lot. Kinda like to write out my thoughts though, so bear with me (har har).\n\nThis looks really similar to the crash in May. I don't know if it'll play out exactly the same, but personally I am making moves based on that assumption.\n\nRight now GDAX is hovering right under an important fib point ($355) and previous resistance/support ($350). There is very little resistance going upwards (600 coins~ around $350), but no one is biting. [RSI on the 4-hour](http://i.imgur.com/0QgZ3JH.jpg) also had a very similar bounce as what happened in May. Ended up being a massive bull trap (almost fucked me last time).\n\nA lot of support heading downwards, almost 19,000 ETH in bids going down to $300, BUT if any heavy selling starts, I won't be surprised if people get cold feet and start pulling their orders capitulating this further down.\n\nRight now, I would be looking at two numbers.\n\n1) If ETH can break $355 convincingly, things are most likely consolidating or short-term bullish.\n\n2) If ETH tests $315 again and breaks under on heavy volume, then it'll most likely drop down to $290 if selling is weak or as low as $250 if sell pressure is strong.\n\nI don't work today (whoo!) so I'm not placing any orders, but will watch the books around those numbers and most likely buy in whichever way it does turn.\n\nIf we do head south, I'd personally play things carefully. Historically, these bounces are anywhere from 5-10% from the bottoms. If you get in right at the bottom, take profits quickly. It's hard to predict the absolute floor. It's okay to jump back in higher when things are clearly bullish.\n\nEDIT: [FUCKING VICKY](https://twitter.com/Vickicryptobot/status/875036260531875840)\n\nWhat a champ.

Bounced back up, but it looks like a fart of a bounce and I'm guessing we're going to sink further. Sell volume hasn't even been strong yet during this dip.

If you don't actually \"buy\" more ETH with it, more leverage doesn't seem to hurt. Fees are the same on 2x vs 5x, unless you are trading 2.5x as much ETH of course.\n- I think using fiat for collateral is definitely the best option, things can get bad quick if you're holding & trading ETH, because the value of the collateral goes down when the trade goes bad, amplifying the problem. You can hold BTC but we've all seen that dive with ETH or even cause ETH to dive plenty of times, fiat is the most stable by a country mile.\n- I really like the settle option on long positions too. Let's say I'm looking at enough profit to buy 0.5 ETH and ready to close out. I'll close my position for N-0.5 ETH, then immediately use the fiat profits to settle out the remainder of the position because you get to buy the ETH at the opening price. If you've just ridden a 10-20% price increase that can be a nice option.\nHaving said that, you might want to grow your fiat stack a little bit first so you can safely make bigger trades rather than turning it straight into ETH.\n- Subjectively using old school Cryptowatch with the API key is slightly more reliable than trade.kraken.com but only just, they are both a bit hit or miss and YMMV.\n\nHave fun but also be careful! Kraken can be very laggy sometimes and I've just gotten used to having to enter trades multiple times if it lags/bugs out.

So it may be that any market gyrations will be muted somewhat.  \n\n\nPersonally still have core positions in case of a market rise and a good chunk of fiat ready to go to work if the market drops.  I'm less inclined to FOMO, and more inclined to wait for dips.   My thought on ETH is that anything under 200 will probably be profitable buys on most time horizons.  Where to sell over 200 is the big question..  I have already gotten a good number of sub 200 or close to 200 buys and > 205-210 sells.\n\n\nGood luck everyone!\n\n\nEDIT:  One call I will make is that I think Bitcoin revisits 2300 by Jul23. what this does to ETH I'm not entirely sure but suspect it will drop somewhat as well.

We get close to 300 and I'm thinking, \"naw, it's a mental barrier, 300 is going to be strong it can't...\"   and 300 is utterly destroyed, like  it was made of tissue paper\n\n3.

I check my possible losses - about 50 ether and counting...\n\n5. 316 hits and we bounce back down   Me:   sigh...this is real.  damnit.  I'll put a buy out there at 305 and just try to jump back in, mitigate my losses.  I did look and think \"hmm...maybe it's a rounded top, it looks that way but on 15 min time scale I doubt it matters..eh..whatever.\"\n\n6.   Watching it, finally can't stay up anymore and I need to go to bed.    I sleep badly.  before bed I set a alarm on my app to make a noise if (yeah! right!..as if) if it hits 301.\n\n7.  Very short time later, phone goes off.    I jump out of bed and get to my computer in time to see 301 dropping.   I immediately sell.    I manage to get half sold before it spikes back up nearly immediately to 305.    I smile a little, but I also say to myself \"you're chasing it, stop you're going to lose doing this...it's going to go back up and you'll have just undone everything\".    I think for a bit, \"I don't think the confidence in the market is there right now\"  and I set 7 sells each going down by 5 cents, hoping i don't get bot blocked.  I set these for 298 --> 297.50.   \n\n8.  I go back to bed, and set my phone to go off if the price goes below 282 (yeah...no way...but whatever)\n\n9.  short time later phone goes off.  I wake super confused not understanding whats happening.  I run to my computer see the price at 283 and coming back up, I see that I've sold everything and I'm entirely in fiat, and I immediately buy back in at 284.\n\n10.

Conclusion ETH is weaker than BTC so if BTC dumps ETH will keep dumping even more.\n\n2)  Not the slightest support at 200 usd, passed through 185 like it didn't exist with lower volume btw at 175 USD.  We still haven't found our support line.  I honestly will be surprised if 160 holds.  I am convinced 160USD will be tagged if not in the next few days within a week for sure.\n\n3)  Last time I checked total support for segwit was floating at 85% but while support for this has improved the mechanisms for signaling are different.  Take a look at blockchain.info stats on segwit btw ~45%.  Network is still split on HOW segwit comes about.  BIP91 or BIP141/148.  While there is consensus on moving forward with segwit there is not a consensus on which BIP activates it.\n\nNow lets talk details.  As predicted by self and others volatility is expected to go up here.  Trading sentiment is negative, and charts support this.   If you are playing short good luck to you because as others have posted IF issues with Bitcoin resolves expect a significant up move in ETH.  BUT as I have stated above ETH basically has a negative drag on it.  Bitcoin could go to 2600 but I would be surprised to see ETH trade much above 240.   Even if Bitcoin revisits 3000 I honestly would be surprised to see ETH trade much above 260-270.  Shorts will pile on again if we get a rise..  If you are long you want shorts to pile on here lower to set the stage for a short squeeze.\n\nHonestly $400 ETH is looking more like it won't happen again this year.\n\nThe negatives.  ICO drag.  Block reward (ice age was delayed at least a year).  A lot of FOMO buyers holding ETH at higher prices.  Generally ETH falling more and rising less with same Bitcoin moves.  No tangible good news or developments.   Scaling is still a major issue.  Government regulation is under discussion in many major governments (US/EU).   Price broke psychological level of $200 easily.  The longer this stays below $200 the stronger the resistance there.\n\nThe positives.  A lot of people who took profits on ETH are waiting to plunge in again.  Shorts are heaping on.  All the previous ETH buyers stuck at higher positions, if still in, will be looking to add and hold.  ETH isn't going away, just dropping in price.  Which means players looking at $1000 ETH in a few years will be drooling at $100 ETH or lower entry prices.  News flow - at least more people are learning about crypto!\n\nIn the short run I see $160USD tagged possibly as low as $100-120 in next 1 to 3 months.   $200 will be psychological resistance on the upside.

I will agree with you the USAF is what tried to break the log jam but the way I see it right now we have about 40% mining power signaling BIP91 and another 45% signaling BIP141/148.   The problem here and realize I AM NOT AN EXPERT just relaying my understanding from what I have read is that we have two different code bases signaling for segwit via two different BIPs.  I don't see the non 2xblock HF camp all of a sudden loading up the BIP91 code, nor do I see the miners dumping the BIP91 code and going for core with segwit or USAF..\n\nI also have not heard one thing about ANY of these code bases addressing the replay attack issue that burned a lot of brokerages in the past.\n\nI find it funny everyone is talking about how 85% of the network is signaling for segwit but no-one is talking about how we still don't have consensus on what BIP locks that in?    But this is complex enough I am the first to say I don't understand the depth of this issue.  The fact IT IS COMPLEX leads me to believe that no-one has an endgame for how this resolves without a USAF chain split on AUG1 without everyone going for BIP91 by JUL29.  Frankly the community is so split I see the odds of that happening as basically 0.   I also have a strong suspicion all the talking heads that say solution solved because segwit has 85% support will be in utter shock on AUG1 when the network splits due to USAF.\n\nDon't get me wrong here I think USAF was a brilliant play.  But given the miners head in the sand about not simply going with USAF or core here and waiting to push for 2x block HF and going with their own BIP91/codebase will be the prime reason Bitcoin splits.  I see a split as more than 50% likely and going up the more I hear 'Bitcoin problem solved'.\n\nBTW:  imo BIP141/148 does NOT solve the scaling issue, nor will a block size increase.  These only defer the problem.   The way I see this is the only way to improve tx rates is by moving tx's off the public chain.  But then this doesn't really solve the on chain scaling problem does it?!   This is the real problem and core devs have been beating their head on it for years now without a real solution.

If you look at this from a block mined perspective it looks great.  The fact only 5 major mining operations mine like 85% of all blocks doesn't say shit about the rest of the Bitcoin eco-system but makes segwit2x activation look easy peasy.\n\nNow I think I understand why this is so contentious and why a large number of people are dumping Bitcoin for Ethereum and other alts.  The plain and simple of it is that if how Bitcoin develops and is run centralizes with the miners then there will be no stopping the next changes.  How about upping the block reward and continuing it indefinitely?  Increase block sizes even further centralizing mining into a few large networks and ASIC farms.\n\nThe surest and simplest way to vote on this is by selling/exchanging your Bitcoin.\n\nThis is why Ethereum is moving up more, a good chunk of old Bitcoin money is literally voting against the miners of Bitcoin.

I think too many people are tossing the 80% around and AFAIK BIP91 code isn't even out of the testnet much less on production machines.    Though it is slated for release in a mere 10 days.\n\nAlso 80% of what? nodes or blocks mined or just signaling the NYA?   I see far too many people looking at this from a blocks mined perspective which is what 5 miners?.   I call this a hashjority but it is far from a 'majority'.   While hash drives blocks and the chain when I view that 5 main miners can basically drive the protocol by blocking BIP141 and promoting BIP91 and a built in 2x blocksize HF I see this as significant centralization.  It basically kicks the consensus can down the road to November and is a forced miner centralization.\n\nThis is exactly what the miners or NYA crowd seems to want but for some reason this crowd would not simply signal for BIP141 on the existing core codebase and stand by their pitch that next step should be a 2x blocksize HF to kick the scaling can.   No they have to code in a very aggressive 2x blocksize HF as well.\n\nI would have preferred miners backed down and played their cards better.  There IS absolutely no reason they can't adopt the core code base and signal for BIP141 now.   They won't.  In the end this screams split to me.   Maybe not now, maybe even not  in November, but at some point later.   If this goes through as planned by the miners it will be a Bitcoin owner/user frog in a slowly warming pot.  It won't be a matter of IF the miners turn up the heat on the community, but simply when, how and in the end 'how much'.\n\nRight now for a small size of the community the heat is already too much and they have effectively jumped out of the Bitcoin2x pot.\n\n", 1], ["2017-07-11 20:31:59", "1h MACD going up, but 1min going down.", 1], ["2017-07-11 20:35:53", "by next resistance, do you mean $250?", 1], ["2017-07-11 19:18:37", "Totally unprofessional.

A new moderator.  The sub creator Bitcoin_Schmitcoin doesn't post anymore.  More new bodies talking more about trading rather than general analysis of the trading or the ETH ecosystem. etc. etc.  I am a long time website creator and maintainer and I've seen the way how these things go.  \n\nIn the end I was excited to finally be able to post here but I'm beginning to find reddit threads getting diluted off topic (ETHTrader a perfect example, there are more) but I'm also agnostic to 'mods'.   Oh the old nntp days when there were only people to nudge others to stay on topic and that basically was the only rule..\n\nAh well.   I will post one of my last trading analysis's here.\n\nFirst point reading Bitcoin_Schmitcoins analysis.\n\nThe key point to a double bottom indicating that it is the low IS that the second drop MUST have higher volume than the first and NOT go lower than the price of the first.    This is a key rule on double bottoms I'm not sure if he quoted or not.   The higher this volume is on the second drop the stronger the bump up after the double bottom is hit.  IF the price drops and doesn't clip the bottom again (looks just like a double bottom) but with volume on the subsequent drop dropping or never exceeding the previous on a drop it 'may' be a double bottom but with much lower probability and definitely much less of a powerful upswing up of it should it happen to have been one.\n\nSecond point while one can draw fib lines if you forget the history of the price movement you completely wash out what is going on.  I see this in Bitcoin_Schmitcoin's chart as well.   The whole rise in ETH is obscured by the analysis points.   175 is NOT a magic number here.   ETH barely formed support in 60 or 90 ranges and surely didn't form much going from 90 to 400.   There literally is barely any volume, and virtually zero time for backfilling for support building in this 90-400 range much less support testing.\n\nWhat is being witnessed right now IS that backfilling and support testing.   175 currently IS the line to watch.  If this market is going to gain traction 175 must hold with at least the same but preferably higher volume than the first drop (I do not count the flash crash in this as this was a not-normal event).\n\nThe other point I don't see B_S mention is that we have been in a solid band down from the ATH with ETH for almost a month.   The highs are lower and the lows have typically been lower.   Low side of this band is now running around $100-120 with the high side in the 240's. (USD)\n\nNothing has changed this pattern.\n\nAs to discussion of Bitcoin this is only in connection to ETH as these are still strongly correlated.    Of small note was that in the last day ETH was starting to slowly trend up while BTC was effectively going sideways.  Indicated a slight positive movement of ETH vs. BTC but so small that I simply note it and set it aside against the overall trends.\n\nI am looking at the moves again.  I see a retest of BTC 2250 on the horizon, and we shall see where ETH lands.  Hard to call ETH much below 184 unless BTC drops below 2250.   I may have to bring up my old failed call for ETH 175 and BTC 2150-2200 but lets see what happens at BTC 2250.\n\nRight now movement is starting down.\n\nGood luck and take care everyone.

The times I did so I timed it watching BTCUSD, and ETHBTC ratios and timing things correctly. These day's we're in uncharted territory with no real indicators and thin order books, anything can happen. Given I'm up 60%+ still even at $75, I'm choosing to hodl for now.

Those sort of investments have made it easier to make some other (educated) gambles. I don't necessary look at really long term sustainability, I will try to ride something up and continue to sell small portions of the asset to lock in profits.

I try to include all platforms in my portfolio, to make sure I don't miss out on any possible leading blockchains.

Only at around 5mln market cap, it's a fork of Lisk and they are trying to decentralise the internet through IFPS. Similar to Maidsafe for instance, but I believe they're the only one trying IFPS right now. With Lisk at a 170mln market cap, that would mean a ROI of 34x if Shift manages to get there. Their marketing is non existent right now but I have good feelings about this one.\n\nVIA: Altcoin that is still pretty much under the radar I think.

With Bitcoin less than 45% of market dominance now, it's becoming less of an impact. If it gets squeezed down to maybe 30%'s or so, it would be less impact. The fact is most currencies right now are paired to BTC. One goes down, it brings the market down.

Running toward .1 and this is significant as it continues to signal the shift away from Bitcoin to Ethereum.  In fact I think this is the biggest trend going on lately any selling in this ratio will either push Bitcoin up (unlikely) or drop Ethereum (most likely).  So far the ETH/BTC longs are winning the day.   As to double top.   Here is example of double top reversal http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:double_top_reversal and double top break out\n\nHere is another variant.  Normally the break up is related to the amount of time within the pattern.\n\nhttp://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:pnf_charts:pnf_bullish_bo\n\nThe problem here is that while it appears we have a base around $120 we really don't have much banding.  Rather than going higher I'd rather see this break back down to say $180 and revisit 220 at least 1 to 2 more times.   Every break up simply leaves a vacuum where support is unknown and leaves ETH prone to wild swings and unstable.   Which ever way the wind blows is where ETH goes.   What has always bothered me about crypto is how I can see an advance on what appears to be high volume literally be erased with a drop of same amount on 1/10th the volume.   In most normal markets it means your price is literally floating on thin air and can drop hard and fast should someone short the thing hard and deep enough for long enough.   In the crypto space this seems to be 'normal' since I have seen it constantly in both Bitcoin and Ethereum while they have rallied to new ATHs only to be crushed and rise again.   The biggest issue here is that new money on new exchanges is coming in and this may take us to a new ATH.   If I believe elliot wave analysis we got our 5th wave from 80-100 to 160-200 in place.  Next wave could take us to 320-400 but eventually one of these waves has to go down.   As an investor we want this.   I sold another ETH up here at 211 and am still holding more than I had into the last run with more cash than I had.  I'm putting in staggered orders from about $185 down to $120 to catch any piece of a fall back to $120 and will wait.  If it goes up great!  If it goes down even better!  As to a head and shoulder reversal - that pattern is broken.   The double top is what we are looking at now and trying to decide if it will break out or reverse.  If it reverses $180 is a realistic downside target.  $120 is where real resistance seems to be forming.", 14], ["2017-05-30 21:32:44", "Taking off for a while.

Every correction has been very short lived. Things are looking pretty bright, I won't make a numbers prediction, but I will say this:\n\nWe are not in a bubble, not even close, by definition our market cap has not exceeded the intrinsic value that the blockchain and Ethereum's platform possesses. With that said, there can still be a crash from the majority of the market believing there to be a bubble. This I think would occur in a form of a minor crash or a correction that is oversold to an X degree. A \"crash\" to me depends purely on the variable of shaky knees comparing traditional market analysis and standardized growth to the cryptocurrency realm, and panic following suit. Or maybe, just a mass amount of people taking profits.\n\nI also believe TA is becoming less and less meaningful at a time like this, as the news and hype cycle will repeat for the next two EEA releases, Raiden, and Metropolis (If they're successful, this could even repeat into Casper and PoS). This is on top of the fact that Ethereum is becoming a buy the news coin. We are currently being propped up by all these releases and I do not see that changing unless...\n\n1.) The next round of EEA is underwhelming (I have my doubts it will be), but if this occurs, on round three of the EEA I believe could shift into a sell the news event given\n        - The release date is stated beforehand\n       - If the news is anything but VISA, Amazon, Tesla, Walmart, United Nations, etc..\n\nor \n\n2.) Raiden and or Metropolis get delayed till 2018, or if they become a failed addition to the platform.\n\nI would personally be honing in on BTC TA at the moment, because I believe BTC is following TA more than Ethereum and will continue to do so. None of the shenanigans in the BTC community has effected its growth, and I can't see many more occurrences down the road short term that will have an overall negative impact on price. Bitcoins fundamentals and intrinsic value still stands amidst the hurricanes today and has for 8 years, I believe this trend will continue.\n\nI think there is money trading to be made on the Ethereum Bitcoin pair using TA and traditional market studies on Bitcoin itself. Otherwise, in my personal opinion, we are in a very psychological and hype playing field when it comes to Ethereum. This will be a very interesting year and excited for what's to come. I use to go to EthTrader's dailys to expand my knowledge by bounce ideas, having friendly debates, or by simply reading and finding good info. Lately, I do not have the time nor patience to scan 100 comments to find just one that adds to my personal understanding of the cryptoshpere or to catch a current event. I'm hoping this sub grows slowly, and stays a hidden gem that use to be EthTrader only 3 months ago. I'm hoping that we can all leave this place after daily reading taking away something new, it doesn't have to be sentiment changing, it doesn't have to be magnificent, just something, anything that will position us as individuals ahead of the market. With EthTrader having 25k subs, I think that qualifies as enough market share, and reading that daily will not keep us ahead of the curve IMO.\n\nSorry for the long ass post, but with the current dip and sharp rebound today, and after reading the daily realizing that 80% of the people there don't see Google as their friend, I just wanted to give my sentiment on these two subject matters. Open to thoughts and even more so to disagreements with my opinions above. I've found personally the best way to learn and stay ahead is to listen, indulge, stay humble, then profit...

I agree a drop may come soon, no more than 10% and won't last more than a week but then Bitcoin will resume the trend up and we will find out whether we crack the ATH or blow off it on increased volume signalling the double top and a retrace down.

You don't talk about your investment time horizon, or your goals, and these are will play into any advice anyone should give.  If a person you are asking advice from doesn't ask this then they are not someone you want to listen to in my opinion.    A lot of people (including myself) are convinced that Ethereum should reach market cap parity with Bitcoin 'at some point'.   The question is when and how this happens.   Were I to advise someone regarding 'crypto' in general.  I'd say 'spread' it around a bit and don't do it all at once.   Since you are here I'd say you are aware and have the means to buy Eth.  If you have that then you should at least look at Bitcoin as well.  Don't try to pick a single winning horse out of a pack, but pick a few.  Many here come from Bitcoin and were looking to diversify out of Bitcoin into other things.  Ethereum is a natural, logical choice as a second for many reasons discussed elsewhere.  Beyond that opinions will differ greatly.   Personally since I like to trade I'd take the 5k and start making mini trades (2-5ETH) no more than 10ETH and see if I could build up some ETH by trading.  This gives you a feeling for the markets, costs to buy/sell and details about how you will book gains for taxes etc.   Many people do not trade, and many that do lose money.  If you simply want to invest and hold long ETH I might buy $500 worth at a time.  If it goes up and you miss out you will feel better buying more.  If it drops you will cost average in lower.   I heard a saying it is not timing the market, but the time IN the market.  But I point out to all people who say this, you don't make profit if you never sell so both entering and exiting needs to be planned.   I'm here for long haul both in Bitcoin and Ethereum. I like to trade around positions to increase my return and the volatility in crypto is great for trading, but not for feint of heart investors.  You could buy today and the price crushed to $20 only to go to $80 a month later.  You have to have balls of steel and a really good plan to follow or you will be handed your ass faster than you can say S.H.I.T!

My first impression based on what you are saying is to stay away from a trading bot, or trading and look at this from investment perspective as this will require less time and have less chance of screw up. All good advisors tend to tell people to spread their buys over time since going 'all-in' gives you no chance to cost average.   It always felt better to buy a little, watch the price go up and buy some more, if the price goes down you just keep buying lowering your cost average.  But this is 'me' not 'you'.   If I was thinking I had a 2 year horizon and a price target of $80 or above I'd just plop the 5k down and then decide whether to sell 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 at the target price to get some of my investment back and ride the rest for another double.  Sell another chunk to get my fiat double and ride whatever was left long term.   Realize you may have to stomach a very volatile ride here.   Many think it unlikely ETH drops to 20 or lower, but it could.   Stick with your time horizon and your sell targets whatever they are.  Your call how you want to buy in and sell targets/amounts to get cash out.   I think if you were to do a poll of whether ETH will double in 12 months or less 90% of the people would say yes.  One last thing people harp on.  If you buy the ETH and will keep it long term then get it into a hard wallet and don't leave it on an exchange.

While it's great that all of these companies are signing onto ETH via EEA, there really isn't anything physically tangible to show for it yet by way of specific products developed by any of these companies. Also, what functioning dapp has even flirted with mainstream adoption other than in dedicated ETH communities (knowledge in this area is a little outdated, someone please inform me if I am incorrect)? \n\nHow I see it there are two major categorizations of populations who invest in cryptos:\n\n1.

Which is why I think there is a small bubble. At some point down the line I think we'll be due for a major *prolonged* correction (unless somehow ETH steamrolls positive development and change with absolutely no problems). Who knows when and where. Commodities that trade on potential aren't sustainable no matter how much you believe in the technology just by the fact that there are more people with more money in this who have no idea what the tech is than there are ardent believers and are just riding the wave.\n\nSilver lining is, it won't be a bubble where everything crashes and burns and we're left limping along for a couple years. We'll rebound quick, because while the 1st population is smaller, it's still sizable and they're some of the most dedicated people with a zealous like belief in this tech.\n\nAs for myself, I'm not much of a technical guy and only have a rudimentary understanding of the tech, but I'm a believer in its fundamentals.

Do you really want to listen to someone with an Economics degree here?   I think most of them would tell you to look up bubble market because the rationale for 'value' at this point particularly in ETH is 95% speculation 5% value.   Bitcoin perhaps has 90% speculation and 10% value.  But these are out of my ass numbers.\n\nThe real value proposition in ETH is that if it penetrates any of the following markets to any significant extent and can generate 5-10% cost savings in them then ETH will represent a significant value generator.   Markets are financial, insurance, medicine, law, government, and span the entire globe.   I was just reading that in the financial markets basically in the US alone $2T is spent by Credit Card and ~2T in Debit Card transactions.   If ETH could take 10% of this market and generate 10% savings on transaction costs (typically run ~3%) this would yield $2T*.1*.1*.03 or ~$600M/yr on US CC transactions alone.

If not I suggest quickly reading into it and understanding how it works. But basically think of it as a loan. If you are going short with a margin trade, you are borrowing say 1 ETH from the exchange with the promise that you will pay them back that 1 ETH later. In the meantime however, you are betting that the price is going down. So you borrow this 1 ETH and immediately sell it, for say $225. You then ride the market out and say the price reaches $150, you can buy back the 1 ETH you owe and give it back to the exchange. You have now earned $75 on the 1 ETH you borrowed. \n\nNow the exchange isn't going to let any schmuck take a free loan, so they require what's called collateral. Basically it's insurance for the exchange that you will be able to pay back the loan gave to you. I won't go into the details but margin trading becomes much simpler because you never have to worry about juggling your balance between ETH and fiat. You can have a perpetual stack of fiat that you attempt to grow and grow by taking margin positions. It's actually more straight forward this way because you can always go short OR long whereas if you are doing unleveraged trades you are constantly in a position one way or another. If your stack is in fiat, you are always in a short position while if your stack is in ETH than you are always in a long position. If you try to stay 50/50 to be agnostic then you will quickly find it unsustainable because as soon as you want to lean a certain direction you will unbalance your 50/50 split.\n\nSorry for such a ramble I'm not making this very concise. If you aren't doing margin trading going short would mean holding fiat, then buying ETH when it drops to $150. Problem is this is betting that ETH will then go up which you don't know. You might have good reason to believe ETH might go down to $150 but in an unleveraged trade you are perpetually taking a position whereas with leveraged trading you can remain purely on the sidelines until you see a precise 'buy at X price sell at Y price' scenario because you can 'close' your position.

ETH may be the current poster child for this type of action.  Tack on the high rate of inflation (ice age looks to be delayed by 1-1.5 years now) and as the ICO market trys to take more money/ETH from the market the heavier the weight on ETH price.  Put simply I have a hard time here believing that ETH goes substantially higher if we have ~$10M/day of block reward interest (this is nothing compared to ICO pull of money on the market) and like a few hundred million a week of ICO being pulled from the ETH market.   This really is starting to put a significant weight on ETH itself.\n\nI since any Tom, Dick and Harry can put out an ICO for whatever amount and however they want it.  There literally is nothing that stops anyone from using ICOs to scam for money and no mechanism to slow down this market other than more and more ICOs and less and less money/ETH being put into them over time.\n\nRight now there is $24B in the ETH market but this is being eroded I think predominantly by the billions being tossed into the ICOs.  Add the ETH ICOs markets caps up and ETH basically would have a higher market cap than Bitcoin now if all the money stayed in ETH vs. being pulled into all the ICOs..\n\nI'm curious what other people think with regards to the drag on the ETH price from the heavy and growing ICO market in ETH.   Can the ETH market sustain $200M/week of drain and still rise in price if these ICOs don't produce anything?", 6], ["2017-07-05 16:53:28", "I published this today on TradingView\n\nhttps://uk.tradingview.com/chart/ETHUSD/PYWTdltm-ETH-downtrend-to-continue-but-could-turn-bullish-soon/\n\nLooking closely at the $240-250 range for a bottom.

The volume is only slightly up through this (no more than 2x) and of course is a little higher during the bull runs.  I see occasional BTC sell offs but they are absorbed and price moves higher.\n\nI think a number of players are looking at BTC and ETH appears to be being 'dragged' with BTC because of the ratio positions.   On a few occasions ETH would rise if BTC dropped as if the ratio buyers are smelling a ratio run (i.e. ETH up BTC down).  But so far BTC has been the real first mover.  ETH simply followed.  Notice BTC up ~50% and ETH up about 50% over same period keeping the ratio intact around .08-.09.\n\nI think what we are looking for is a BTC pull back but I don't expect this to be a significant trend until we get into the SegWit2x block size HF.  This event should put some volatility into BTC, what ETH does in the face of this is hard to say but given the way the ratio is trading may try to find legs (go to .1 at least and look for .15 as top).   With ETH at ~300 this would mean BTC dropping to 2k.  Hard to say if BTC will go this low.\n\nLets look at ETH making 400 with BTC at 3k this gives a ratio of about .13.  Now if BTC holds ~4k and ETHBTC makes a run to .15 would give a ETH top of about 650 (all in USD).\n\nMy guess here is that ETH will not break to a new ATH unless there is some news.  BTC breaking down below 2k and ETH at 400 (or a ratio of .2) would be about as far as I'd expect the ratio to go here.\n\nFrankly the trading feels like we are waiting for something and buyers are mostly going after BTC.  I feel like BTC needs to retrace to about 3300-3350 before extending the current move up.  I expect a BTC drop to be rather short lived until we get closer to October.\n\nBTW:  One of the reasons ETH moved with BTC was also probably due to a combination of short covering and FOMO on fiat positions and maintenance of the ETHBTC ratio.\n\nGood luck holders and traders!", 2], ["2017-08-12 01:03:54", "Seems like we have hit a resistance in the 298-303 region...

Interesting day today on the TA front. Lets get into it.\nYesterday we saw pressure building up, BBands were tightening and so we were waiting for a breakout in either direction. TA yesterday wasnt very clear as to which direction that would be. Until it eventually broke, downwards. Looking at the 4h chart we can see some exchanges have broken below the Kumo on the 4h time frame. Chart: http://imgur.com/a/wDLOD Here it did. Chart: http://imgur.com/a/J36hB Here it didn't yet. RSI got a nice recharge. Once this is convincingly broken we can assume a serious leg down and downtrend for a couple of days. If we're looking short term, this might actually be a good spot to open a short. Were getting close to the resistance channel on 30m: http://imgur.com/a/1U0YA\nZooming out to the 1d, we can see we are still trading at very high prices. This could potentially correct to the 150-200$ range. RSI is also still very high on this time frame. Chart: http://imgur.com/a/DgsfW I would suggest keeping an eye on the 4h chart, if a second break is made on the kumo, we're gonna take a dive. Of course the longer it takes for that next leg down, the higher support will be found, as indicated by the 3 arrows I drew on the previous chart. The reason why I am still waiting for one more technical signal before opening a big short are more fundamental, and explained in the next paragraph.\nSo where is this going? And when should I open a trade? In many respects the price deserves to go down. But over the past weeks Eth has been notoriously resistant to downtrends; finding support fairly soon. When BTC and ETH moved synchronized last week and both dumped aggressively we saw ETH finding support on the 4h Kumo where Bitcoin went below it. Two reasons I can think of for this: ICO's and Asia. Most ICO's are funded with ETH which gives buyer pressure. One could think of every ICO as an amount of ETH placed in cold storage, lowering circulating supply. This is of course a double-edged sword. Buying ICO tokens is like buying stocks of a company that isn't there yet. Over time many ICO's will fail and that money will flow back to either ETH or Fiat. A second caveat is the fact that the ETH now in control of the ICO will gradually (for now) be converted to fiat as bills need to be paid. And the world still works in fiat. SO basically everyone rallies to get ETH to invest in a company which will slowly convert it back to fiat, causing sharp increases and gradual decreases in the price. How much of an effect this has, I dont know. We need more data for this.\nSecondly Asia. ETH has been added to Asian exchanges and this opens up a whole new market, TA is scarce on their exchanges, but it's likely a bubble on its own. They are trading at a premium for some time now. This is how I think the price will develop. Note that I am a rather conservative trader, I trade mainly big swings, and only after multiple signals, potentially missing out on profits. I am bearish for the coming week, but awaiting for a good entry, and we are getting close: http://imgur.com/a/iwl3t I'm not really fond of these prediction arrows, but whatever.\nHappy Trading Etherians!", 9], ["2017-06-21 14:36:10", "Top 3 volumes for BTC, ETH>BTC, XRP>BTC, LTC>BTC.\nSeems like alts to BTC migration is in progress... \nEDIT: LTC>BTC fell to 5th place by volume.

Anyway here it is.\n\nBack about a month ago when we made the rise to $40, then $50, everyone was cheering the flipping was happening. I made a fairly popular post about it. https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/61cinw/the_flippening_is_here/ \n\n\nI've come back with more data to show that we are well into the flippening.\n\n\nThe Flippening is not necessary about Ether's rise, but more or less about how Bitcoin's market cap and value continues to decrease allowing for other Cryptocurrencies like Ether to take over and become major players. Today the global market for all currencies is currently at $32.7B USD. This is outstanding, coming up from almost $2B in over a single day, with more than half of that being Ether's price increase from $51 to $60 we are at currently in the last day. \n\n\nNow, we have all been tracking Bitcoin prices. We're in a bit of a bubble, with Bitcoin at a ATH of $1335 on GDAX, and $1425 USDT on Bitfinex. All market indicators have shown Bitcoin to be SEVERELY oversold, with the Bitfinex / USDT bank issues being the center fold. Bitfinex has created it's own Mt. Gox like bubble with users unable to get Fiat in or out via banks to USDT, driving USDT down to current price of $0.931 USD on Kraken. Things are different now though, as users can exit and withdraw their Bitcoin to other exchanges, such as GDAX, Kraken, Gemini, etc. This is has been shown the case as many of Bitfinex cold address reserves have shown MASSIVE withdrawals over the past 2 weeks this build up has been going on. People wanting to exit buy BTC on Bitfinex, driving prices up, then transfer to other exchanges or private wallets. Some people have exited on GDAX, driving the price different for other exchanges down. What I speculate is many are sitting on their Bitcoin, waiting for the moment that everyone who wants out of Bitfinex is over, and buy pressure stops. They are waiting for the price to top out so that they can sell and take major profit. On top of this, the entire run up has been on low volume. Very unhealthy. \n\n\nWhen this Bitfinex bubble pops, and people stop buying on Bitfinex.. and price starts to drop, Bitcoin's price will drop even further, reducing both it's Market Cap, and Market Cap percent to a HUGE degree.\n\n\nNumbers: \nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/charts/\nYou can see, as of just over a month ago, March 8th for example, Bitcoin had 84.5% of the CryptoCurrency market cap. Total market cap was at about $22.7B at the time, making bitcoin at $19.2B, and all other Altcoins including Ether at $3.5B. \nSince then... Ether, Altcoins, and Tokens have SURGED. Currently...even with the recent RALLY/BUBBLE of Bitcoin to $1340, Bitcoin only holds 65.1% of the Market Cap, which is $32.8B currently, making Bitcoins market cap about $21.4B currently. The entire Cryptocurrency market cap has SURGED. Bitcoin gained $2B, but Altcoins are now $11.4B to the market, Etherum is $5.3B of that combined total, and today alone has surged almost $1B. In the past month Altcoins have added $7.9B to the market cap. THIS IS INSANE and shows the days of Bitcoin dominance is over or at the least about to come to a close. All this.. and Bitcoin hasn't even burst yet. Once it spins down from it's current ATH... we will really see The Flippening\u00a9. At this rate, it will not be long until combined Altcoin totals are higher than Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin remains at these levels, Altcoin's and Ether's pickup will still surpass it eventually, just not as soon as we would hope. \n\n\nThat my friends is my case for the Flippening^\u00a9\n\nSoon^\u00a9", 9], ["2017-04-28 04:31:53", "Not really.  0.05 could still occur with a BTC rise to 1400 or so.

Obviously this is one person's opinion, but I tend to agree with it: http://www.coindesk.com/ripples-xrp-giving-third-largest-cryptocurrency-second-look/\n\nCheck out my chart below, since the June 6th peak it hasn't been able to break through a downward trend. It's tried a few times unsuccessfully. I'd only buy it on confirmation that it breaks the trend upwards. If it gets close to that line again and fails to break through, you have a good short opportunity. Another way to play it is to buy around 6300 sats expecting a bounce.\n\nhttps://www.coinigy.com/s/i/596ba13119a4f/ ", 1], ["2017-07-16 01:31:35", "I did, my friend and financial advisor recommended.

I hope everyone had a great weekend.  For those interested, here is my [Chart of the Day](http://imgur.com/VSPWvzQ).\n\n**TL/DR:  Keep an eye on the upper bounds of the pennant and watch the volume.  If we test the upper bounds and we see a volume breakout from the trend we've seen, this is a great indicator of a significant bull run**\n\n* This chart focuses on the high time scales to gain some perspective on just what the heck is going on in this crazy Ethereum world.  Some people are screaming, \"It's the end!  Down to the teens!!!\".  Well, looking at the 12HR Candles, we can see we are shaping in to a very nice, classically formed, **massive** Bullish Continuation pattern called a **Bull Pennant**.  Some of you may remember that from a few weeks ago when we broke out from the $42.xx range and climbed to $53.xx -- only to be returned to a slightly higher level at $43.xx.\n\nI tried to keep it succinct in my chart and just highlighted the big moments:\n\n1.  Steady, consistent decrease in volume since the Pole was established. \n\n2.  Decreasing RSI\n\n3.  Lower lows within the Pennant are no longer accompanied greater peaks on the MACD (Convergence).\n\n4.  Multiple established tests of upper and lower bounds of the Pennant.\n\n* As an added point of interest, as I outlined in last week's chart, the correlation between BTC and ETH markets cannot be ignored.  At the current moment, BTC is **massively** overbought on the higher time scales and is currently being propped up on very very little volume.  BTC is primed for a significant dump.  And if the correlation between ETH and BTC holds true, that further will provide a boost to push us into a full blown breakout.  Thus, pushing us to a new ATH.  \n\nAs always, I welcome any and all criticism, counterpoints, or commentary with any analysis or arguments I have presented.\n\nHappy Trading!\n\nBitcoin_Schmitcoin.\n\n*  PS:  If you would like to get notifications of my analysis check out my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BTC_Schmitcoin)\n", 11], ["2017-04-10 21:19:09", "BTC has been rising on relatively low volume to the high ($1222) before the ATH, and hasn't been able to beat it all weekend.

Look at the current volume on the rise here vs. relative to the previous, quite a bit higher.   This says two things.  The first is that any dump on Bitcoin is going to require a lot of volume and the price will only move so much, the second is that as volume disappears again the price is going to move higher.   Bitcoin seems to be coiling up and trying to sucker in shorts.  I'd put money down there have been a lot of net sellers or shorts here getting their ass handed to them as Bitcoin rises.

Perhaps a confirmation that $1200 is overbought will come by next Monday.\n\nI'm leaving my ratio long open for the next day or two, and have the funding to be sure it doesn't snap shut, and continuing to buy the dips on ETHUSD.

Look at the volume on the first run and then the sell offs and compare the first run/drop to the second.  If I believe the chart, and big caveat of no earth moving news, I think the current Bitcoin run could take us from 1200 to about 1500 and will take about 2 months to unfold.  There also should be at least one or two more drops, where and when they happen hard to predict but they will be no more than 10% and very short lived based on what occurred in the first run.    The reasoning here is that as the current Bitcoin volume dries up it will mean buyers will have to post higher bids to get any.  At some point some long will sell a chunk into market (usually because they are impatient and want to lock gains).  Then the market just absorbs the shock and resumes the up trend.  Sentiment on Bitcoin is still positive and penetration is weak (a lot more people are coming to play/invest).  After the last move, the consolidation and move higher all happened on weaker volume for at least 2 months with minor sell off events in the middle.   So based on your chart i'm calling Bitcoin at 1500 by 7/1/2017.  I also don't think sub $1000 Bitcoin is in the cards unless Unlimited and Core basically go to war and split Bitcoin into U and C.  My bet is that like Ethereum, that event will be a buying opportunity and money should be split equally between U and C with the total having a higher value after the dust settles.   This entire move up on Bitcoin I'm now calling may put pressure on ETH and get us a buying opp lower with Bitcoin making a new highs.

I believe that the BCH mining difficulty will be dropping on monday though, making chance of block production even lower and thus multiplying the profitability (more blocks, faster).  Could be wrong on that though?  Profitability has climbed to 450%ish a day ago and settled to 372% now.  That's mostly governed by the BCH coin price itself (since each block you mine gets a BCH) but transaction fees also take part (so actual usage of the network). AFAIK BCH price has risen recently largely in anticipation of the mining difficulty lowering (and it has already lowered a few times, so BCH has been gaining velocity).  But just raising the price multiplies the profitability as well, so it's kinda a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Note that the increased number of miners reduces profitability a bit (competition), but that's why the difficulty adjusts itself (and will probably go up in the next iteration, reducing profitability).  Nooo idea how accurate that all is though - just my rough idea of how it works.  Not a longtime BTC or BCH holder, most likely.\n\nRough profitability equation?  \n\nBCH_price / (mining_difficulty * number_of_miners) + number_of_chain_transactions.  \n\nSo if difficulty goes down Monday (will it? hmm) then you'll see an even further spike.  At 2600 PH/s for BCH vs 5500 PH/s for BTC, the gap is already closing in fast though.  I'd doubt that'd change unless the profitability drops below 100% again, but we'll see\n \nEDIT: nevermind ;) difficulty adjustment already happened! https://www.coinwarz.com/difficulty-charts/bitcoincash-difficulty-chart  .

On the other hand, this cuts both ways, as people wanting to short BTC would find the relative market low of the ETHBTC pair a convenient way to enter this position, and instead of seeing a short of ETH we could see a short of BTC's bull run and a rise in value of ETH if a panic is triggered in BTC land.

It's easy to get caught up in the 'fundamentals' and 'developers' and 'amazing tech', but even at $200 per coin ETH has appreciated immensely this year, and saying that we are now in a bear market because we aren't back to $400 yet is imo a bit silly, even for Ethereum itself.

One's incentive to short an asset does not really change based on the price they bought in; if ETH goes from $220 to $200, your P/L will change exactly the same regardless if you bought in at $130 or $190, likewise if it goes from $220 to $240. Yes, there are psychological factors involved with people being more likely to cash out after hitting certain profit %s, but anyone wanting to close after getting their, say, 20% increase from a buy in at $180 would have already done so when we were bouncing off $230 repeatedly. \n\nRegarding panic sell offs on ETH, your ideas also seem rather far-fetched. We've had a LOT of market dumps on Ether recently, and the prices have generally held up well.

Why do you have this conviction that people have to be shorting stuff, anyway? The market had a steady recovery from the earlier corrections and is looking very resilient right now. With BTC breaking its ATH, big multi-day shorts are not the play to go for at all.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound too aggressively pointed against you; but this sub has been far more bearish than really warranted ever since the big correction on ETH and it's been getting a bit too echo-chamberey with all the talks about shorting and selling and waiting in fiat.

That China is basically out to kill Bitcoin.  This is how the major mining players, and personalities there are coming up.  Some are grass roots, but I'll bet that a good chunk of this also has government support basically to try to get control of crypto.  The way to kill an animal is to cut off it's head and feet at the same time.  China kills the front end publicly by taking away people's access to something also making money shorting the market.  Then tries to get in on the back end so as soon as possible China can give access.. wait for it.. to the fully run, and state sponsored new BitChinaCoin  - we just call it Bitch Cha-Ching or BCC/BCH.\n\nThe humor and seriousness aside.

I can't say 4000 will have anything except psychological support.  If it breaks next stop is 3000.

I have a few Long term Analysis points to make.    First the demise of Btc is being called a bit early.   People wondering why $1200 on Btc makes sense with the problems brewing (Unlimited vs. Core).  I think it makes perfect sense if one looks at Btc as being 'limited' in supply and the first cryptocurrency.   The players (miners/devs) there would really have to screw up to destroy that.  Doable should those players or a major player in that space have the means and ability to profit being short.   Dangerous game imo.   I came to ethereum simply because when I looked at the space Ethereum has a lot going for it from the dev side, player side (i.e. big financial players), really fantastic development, but still raw and new compared to Btc.  Right now not a lot of transactions but that will grow.   What I see as the biggest issues facing both Btc and Eth.   Growing tendancy towards centralization either with PoW and miners (Btc) and PoW or PoS (Eth).  In each case the method of securing the blockchains will lead to greater centralization simply due to power to do PoW or money to do PoS.    My biggest complaint in all of this is that users are not consulted at all for votes on changes to their crypto.  I'm talking about the mom and pops or boys and girls if you will who are in these spaces and actually using the crypto to conduct personal transactions.   I know it would be easy to use our wallets to signal as users (if we own Btc or Eth) whether we would vote for say Unlimited or Core, or whatever else but I have yet to hear or read about such mechanisms being incorporated directly 'on chain with transactions'.  I think this is a key use for the blockchains that should be factored into dev/miner decisions.   Anyway this is already long so my apologies.  This thread is for analysis.  In the end I see Btc/Eth being highly volatile 20% or more moves in a day should be expected.  Heck the last ETH buy on gdax to run from 42-45 only took about .5M or 10k ETH to execute with market orders.   so what almost 10% move on barely .01% market cap volume - absolutely THIN trading markets.    In the long run I see Btc at $10k or some good fraction there of.   ETH will carry at least the same overall market cap at some point.   There is room for more than one crypto and they both can win, they also could both lose to something better.  Frankly I don't see the lose being highly likely at this point.

The implication is that average velocities can and are likely to be high\n\nIt makes no sense that monetary velocity would be high just because it's all running on computers. The fiat world mostly runs on computers too.\n\n> the cost of using decentralised protocols is deflationary, since the cost of processing power, storage and bandwidth are deflationary\n\nYes but transaction costs are a small portion of Ethereum's GDP.\n\n> Use cases will be limited [due to cost]\n\nJust a failure of imagination here, I'd say. Also a lack of understanding of scaling solutions.\n\n> The ability to fork protocols maximises utility for users but suppresses economic rent for token holders\n\nBecause Bitcoin's forks really depressed the BTC price, right? He continues this argument later, saying that proof of work is somehow a defense against forking, and proof of stake tokens will go to minimal value because they're trivially forked. I think in practice we'll find that's not the case at all, because network effects really do matter. \n\n>  an aggressive group of forking developers could reallocate the foundation\u2019s tokens to their own new entity in their fork\n\nIt's hilarious that he thinks that fork would attract users.\n\n> Ethereum could serve as the backbone for processing smart contract operations for (hopefully) untold numbers of decentralised applications, DAOs, etc., and perhaps one day maybe even something like the fabled Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \n\nFabled? Does he understand anything about how Ethereum works?\n\nOn page 10, he estimates the value of ETH based on gas fees alone. He ignores that ETH is used as money for lots of other things, like ICO contributions, gambling, ENS registrations, straight-up payments, etc. (His calculation does show why it was smart to ignore all the people claiming ETH was just a fuel, not a currency.)\n\nHe also argues that because PoS will reduce security costs, it will reduce ETH value. I don't think this makes sense because mining expense is a consequence of coin price, not the other way around.\n\nFrom footnote 20:\n\n> At that point it will matter not whether you use Ether, Bitcoin or any other token \u2014 all will work equally well.\n\nExcept that Bitcoin can do 3 tx/sec and has no smart contracts.\n\nHe starts to reveal his bias here, comparing Ethereum with Bitcoin:\n\n> a more complex protocol with a larger attack surface, shorter track record, less decentralised governance and propensity to make backwards incompatible protocol changes, for a hugely robust, stable, proven, and widely accepted protocol that already performs that narrow function very well\n\nThe weakness of Bitcoin will be more apparent when Ethereum's transaction capacity increases by 100X this year. He tries to head this off by claiming that a monetary store of value doesn't also have to be a working payment system. \n\n> Bank deposits are a monetary store of value but are neither a payment rail nor cash... Credit cards clearly aren\u2019t a store of value. \n\nBut they both use the same underlying currency. \n\n> On the other hand, gold is just a monetary store of value but not a payment rail. \n\nBut people used gold for payment for millennia, the dollar was backed by gold until 1971, and even today, certain countries under sanction are using gold for international payments.\n\nThe rest of the paper builds on these same flawed arguments.

The market is irrational: although you would expect shorts to increase while price decreases, it isn't the case. Most people enter their short while price is increasing because they can't predict the top, putting them at a loss. Instead of dumping their positions, they hold until the price starts to drop, then they take profit and dump their positions before the bottom and the price continues to drop, while the number of people in short positions decrease. \n\nMeanwhile, the number of BTC in long positions has stayed more or less constant throughout the drop today (it even increased a little bit), because traders are not willing to take a loss and hope the market will recover.

Not only that, but the last 12HR candle formed a Doji Reversal candle right at the peak of the resistance test.\n\n* The ETH chart did the exact opposite.  At the exact same time we tested the BTC resistance, ETH tested a well established support line.  It tested, got rejected, and formed a Doji Reversal candle right on the support line.  \n\n* Meanwhile, the new high created by BTC formed a Divergence Pattern on the 12HR MACD and was paired with a Convergence Pattern on the ETH 12HR MACD.\n\nMaybe I'm completely full of shit, but patterning strictly on what the chart is showing and not based my crushed spirit as an ETH trader, this is what I believe.  My gut is saying the price will continue to move downward, but the charts are saying otherwise.  Gut feelings ~~are~~ are not measurable, unfortunately.\n\nRemember:  Bulls take the stairs, Bears take the window.\n\nI say this with hesitation because I'm sure I'm about to get engulfed in a shit storm, but \"as always I appreciate and welcome any feedback, commentary, or counterpoints to any of the information I have argued or presented in my charts and analysis\".\n\n**TL;DR:  Contrary to what my gut feeling is saying, charts indicate a prime reversal position.**\n\nHappy Trading!\n\nBitcoin_Schmitcoin. \n\n*Edit:  typos and formatting*", 2], ["2017-04-08 07:48:44", "Been following your posts everyday for a week.

One \u2018justification\u2019 was: let EOS make money while they can \u2013 frankly this structure isn\u2019t making money; it\u2019s taking money (for every cent they raise over the amount the project actually needs) \u2013 this attitude of \u2018take what you can get while you can get it\u2019 causes risks to the whole crypto system, people don\u2019t get their desired return, trust is lost.

EOS are certainly not short of Intelligence (even surface research shows Dan Larimer has a ridiculously strong understanding, not only of the tech but of the political systems that go with blockchain \u2013 watch any of his videos): EOS clearly understand the market demand, which means they are taking advantage of these investors where they raise more than their project requires.

An ethical approach would be to raise as much as they *need* instead of as much as they want - if their project is as good as they say, then they will always be able to raise more later on,once their platform is proven**\n\n\n*Finally the sentiment of being an \"ETH killer\" [one of many examples: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6fwxxt/eos_positio\n] ..perhaps I got a bit emotional/subjective on this one but it pains me to see ETH investors turning their back on BTC, it pains me to see BTC in-fighting and it pains me to see new projects aspiring to be ETH-killers. I appreciate we are in tough competition but the crypto 'industry' is sitting on a world-changing opportunity and in-fighting has, imo, severely hindered progress of the original pioneers  (the crypto market we know). Anecdotal but I think its more widespread than people give credit for: I work for a multinational that sees the crypto industry as a joke because of these issues - they are waiting on the side-lines to invest in the first private chain (run by a big/mainstream corporate tech firm  ..not a crypto pioneer) because \"the corporates are more trustworthy than the crypto circus\" (obviously I disagree with their opinions but the fact they have such an opinion is primarily due to their conclusions on BTC politics).

My group and I will be heavily investing -- but remember to always DYOR.\n\n# What is Quantstamp? \n\nQuantstamp is the first smart contract security-auditing protocol.\n\nQuantstamp is a specialized network that connects developers, investors and users around a transparent and scalable proof of audit in ethereum contracts. The platform will run automated security checks using different code analysis and will eventually expect every Ethereum smart contract to use the Quantstamp protocol to perform a security audit. \n\n\n# Security Breaches in the Past\n\nThe problem with smart contracts is that they are written manually and risk human error. A human error in coding runs a huge risk of hacks that in turn leads to mistakes that could cost millions.  Instead of relying on a single programmer, or even a single auditor, QSP allows the public to audit the smart contract. \n  \n \nIn June 2016, a hacker stole $55 million dollars in Ethereum from the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) due to a bug in its smart contract. In July, another hacker stole $30 million from crypto companies due to a word bug in a smart contract code. Security issues like these are a serious impediment to wider adoption of the Ethereum because they erode trust in smart contracts. In order to increase the adoption of smart contract technology, Quantstamp solves the smart contract security problems and maintains high levels of security for users and  investors from getting hacked. \n\n\n# How It Works\n\nThe essential goal of Quantstamp is to automate the verification of smart contracts on the Ethereum network, removing human actors in trusted sense but allowing them to continue participating as members of the network utilizing QSP tokens to influence events. \n\nQuantstamp uses an upgradable software verification system that can detect these flaws in Solidity, the code use to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Quantstamp technology detects these codes before they happen and recognize attacks while they are happening. Quantstamp uses a series of nodes across the network in both decentralization and termination so if a node goes down, the network keeps working and ensures the smart contract is protected.\n\nCurrently in the state of smart contracts we run the risk of manual coding errors and coders reporting those flaws out of honesty. With Quantstamp the coding is verified automated through a verification program and flaws in coding are reported though an incentive program. There are two types of coders when it comes to reporting blemishes in smart contracts. Samaritan coders are known as  \u201cWhite Hats\u201d and will report flaws and backdoors, while malicious coders known as  \u201cBlack Hats\u201d will try to find ways to exploit those flaws and backdoors. With Quantstamp\u2019s incentive program, reporters are reward with QSP tokens.\n\n# Public Network Participants\n\n* Contributors - The security researchers and people working in closely aligned fields who writes software intended to audit smart contracts written for the ethereum network. They oversee both elements of security research - those who are breaking it and building it. \n\n* Validators  - Validators play the importance of validating transactions on the chain as well as contracts previously verified by the network, in other words, mining of the Quantstamp network. \n\n* Bug Bounty First Responders - Most crucial part of the network. Bounties in QSP tokens are submitted when the source code is sent to the Quantstamp validator smart contract and then held in escrow. Bug finders are then encouraged to attempt to break the code, using any kind of vulnerabilities that they are able to find. If the hacker is able to find a bug in the smart contract, they are then awarded the bug bounty that was being held in escrow.\n\nThere are currently thousands of white hat hackers that are already looking for vulnerabilities, bugs, and exploits in the incumbent software industry. Many of these hackers are able to do this full time, earning a handsome salary from the bounties alone. We are hopeful that these hackers will enter the blockchain industry (many of them already are). \n\n\n# Core Team Members\n\n**Richard Ma - Co-founder & CEO**\n\nStrategy and Business Operations.

The team is respectable, and their vision is clear. Cybersecurity is a booming industry, and is expected to grow to a $5 trillion dollar industry in the next few years. The blockchain industry itself is quite young -- many tech leaders compare present day crypto to 1993 in the rise of the dot-coms. We are still very early. Thus, there is more of a need for an emphasis in security, as protocols and infrastructure is currently being built, and vastly untested in many situations. Many blockchain protocols are open-source and public, and security should be one of the most important aspects to consider going forward.

How far under market price you want to go (slippage) depends on how aggressive you want to be and how quickly the market is moving and how much the exchange is lagging.\n\nSay I want to go short with **100 ETH** and the **current price is 356.00**.\n\nTypically, the order book will be slim on the buying side (because we've had a run up) and there more selling pressure.\nLet's say it takes 100 ETH to move the price to **353.00** (selling) and 100 ETH  to get to **356.50**.\n\nIf you're really aggressive you would just do a market sell to ensure your position. I would **never do market sells/buys** though, because of lagging exchanges/order books and the risk of orders being pulled in slim order books.\n\nInstead you could do a limit sell of 100 ETH at 353.00. If no orders were pulled or trades done from you looked at the order book till your trade, you would effectively had done a market sell without the before mentioned risk.\n\nLess aggressively, you could do a 100 ETH limit sell at 355.00 and only get part of your order filled immediately.\n\nEven less aggressively, you could do a 100 ETH limit sell right before the sell pressure, say at 356.30. In this case you risk sell orders building up under your order and a trend reversal before your oder gets filled.\n\nAll in all: it depends how aggressively you want to trade the swings. \n\nAnother strategy is to keep adding to your winning position: sell short 20 ETH. When price drops 2 points, sell short an additional 20 ETH. When price drops additional 2 points, sell short an additional 20 ETH, and so forth.\nIn this case you limit the downside if the trend reversal doesn't happen, as you only put 20 ETH in it. When you sell the additional ETH short, you have a profit buffer if the trend would reverse immediately after.\n\nWhich way is most suitable depends on your time frame and market volatility, your personality, risk willingness, and your order sizes compared to the order book. If you trade 1 ETH on GDAX ETH/USD you can just do market buys/sell because the spread is often very low and the order books are large enough for 1 ETH to be pretty insignificant. 100 ETH on Kraken ETH/USD can push the market a few bucks though.\n\nI hope it can be of some use!\n\nEdit: Sorry, I didn't actually reply to your questions.
