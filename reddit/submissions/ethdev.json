Or perhaps send into a contract where his address is whitelisted for withdrawal, then there's no doubt about intent.\n\nI've had a similar thought in the past regarding accounts with leaked private keys. Some weekend soon I'm going to write a \"Funds Recovery\" dapp/contract which lets people send in funds which were recovered from compromised accounts. The contract will store the recovered value, the account from which the value was recovered, and the account to which the funds are meant to be returned (call this the rightful owner).\n\nIn order to recover the funds from the contract, the rightful owner must submit a transfer transaction, which will have a required argument which expresses a tip amount to be sent back to the person who recovered the funds. Zero tip will be allowed, but the Dapp frontend will have some A/B tested copy to encourage a nonzero value.\n\nThis accomplishes a number of goals:\n\n1) It incentivizes white hats to compete with blackhats to recover funds\n2) It sidesteps the ethical question of whether a finder's fee should be determined and extracted by the person making the funds recovery without the involvement of the rightful owner (since we're not on the high seas, taking a finder's fee without permission _might_ be considered theft)\n3) It establishes a list of known compromised accounts\n\nLonger term, my goal would be to encourage the makers of the various wallets to prevent sending to any of the known-compromised accounts unless the user types something like \"I understand my ETH will be stolen\" into a popup window, or similar.\n\nAlso there's already a fair amount of gas price competition between blackhat salvagers. I'm not overly optimistic about my chances here, but if things go really well I can imagine geth & parity changing their default transaction prioritization scheme for pending blocks to prioritize transactions recovering funds in this way. This might not be technically feasible, however, as part of the process would need to be to validate that the funds are being returned back to the correct owner. This is fairly simple to do with normal accounts, but it'd get more complicated when funds are recovered from contracts.\n\nIf this is something in which you (OP, or anyone else reading) are interested, please steal my idea!

I imagine that the way it works is, the file is uploaded to your server, and when someone purchases, the server validates the purchase, generates a one-time use link with a token to allow for download.\n\n2. In this case, how is payment validated? If the payment is validated on client side (as they use metamask/mist to pay eth), then the code to generate the one-time link is on client side, and can be observed (and thus a tokened link to the file can be deduced without paying). If the payment is validated on server side, it would seem that you need the user to send their eth public + private keys to your server, because if you only tell the server your eth wallet's public key, anyone else can fake being you.\n\n3. Also on the topic of payment validation, in my experience, the blockchain doesn't reflect the transaction having gone through until after a certain amount of time (maybe minutes, typically).

But then the smart contract serves no real purpose as escrow does not verify file contents anyway.\n\nThis is the primary problem with decentralised marketplaces such as these imo.

The server validates the payment by taking a transaction hash and using the metadata from the transaction to check the product details, price, etc. The issue is that anyone could submit this transaction hash. To fix this, I've implemented an authentication system using private key signatures. My server will send down a random string, and the user has to sign it with their private key. The server will check the signature to verify that you actually control the private key, which proves that the transaction hash belongs to you. See more info about this approach here: https://hackernoon.com/never-use-passwords-again-with-ethereum-and-metamask-b61c7e409f0d\n\n3. Yea, this depends on the gas price you input.

You probably didn't know that Etherscan doesn't display internal transactions which have 0 value.\n\nThe creator of the honeypot created two contracts - the public honeypot and a private contract. The private contract initialized the honeypot by calling `SetPass` (which worked because `hashPass==0x0`) and then `PassHasBeenSet` (which set `closed=true`). These internal transactions aren't shown because they sent 0 ether between the two contracts. Then, the the creator called `SetPass` from a normal account with 1 ether.

You should define what a 'honey pot' is.\n> People don't necessarily know what you are talking about here.

I wish more contract developers would take the time to learn about how the EVM works and what kind of code their contracts compile to. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't think we'll see many new contract languages built on the EVM for several reasons. It's a very difficult VM to support and target, and in some ways requires specific language designs for optimized code. I could go on for hours about this, but I'll leave it at this list:\n\n## 256bit integers\n\nNo modern programming language uses 256-bit integers as it's only native type (for most like C, Rust, C#, etc it is 32bit or 64bit depending on platform). All non-256bit integers must include extra instructions to wrap them to a smaller bit length.. and all math (mostly) must be performed inefficiently using 256-bit integers. If you only need 32bits or only 8 bits, then that's more inefficient because first you must do 256bit math, then round it off and correct it to the smaller size\n\n## Memory system and gas \n\nIts memory space is... something. Instead of explicit allocation of memory or some other mechanism, the EVM allows you to use any amount of memory your gas can pay for. This is done by accessing higher memory addresses. So, if you create a variable, then you just access the next unused memory slot in order to read/write to it. When you no longer need to use that memory, there is no \"free\". Instead you must either not use it (which causes all memory costs in the future to increase), or you must reuse it, which is a significant security risk in case of programming bugs\n\nWhat this means is that if you allocate a variable at address 0x1000, even if you use no other memory in the program, then you will now pay for 0x1000 bytes of memory. So, handling memory fragmentation and compaction is extremely important for keeping the memory size to sane levels (memory costs increases exponentially, so allocating up to 0x2000 is over 4 times (iirc) more expensive than allocating up to 0x1000). However, the cost of handling this fragmentation is not helped by any mechanism in Solidity, and in general would be quite expensive to handle. This is I assume why memory is hardly used by Solidity, opting instead for auto-compacting stack space for variables, at the cost of needing significantly more opcodes to do some operations.\n\nEDIT: Also it's memory is not flat like every other VM and CPU I know of. This basic concept really screws up many assumptions made by programming languages. Address 0 is a 256bit slot, and address 1 is another 256bit slot. There is no such thing as unaligned access to access say, address 0's bottom 128bits and address 1's top 128 bits.\n\n## 256bit integers and packing\n\nBoth storage and memory in the EVM use 256bit integers for both address, and data. So, you can't just trivially store 1 byte of data. You must store at least 32bytes and if your compiler is smart enough it will pack other 1 byte variables into that space. This not only increases the amount of computation needed for accessing these 1 byte variables, but also weakens the security profile. If the compiler has a bug (as it once did a year or two ago) where it doesn't properly round things out to 8bits, then it overflows into the surrounding 1 byte variables, corrupting contract state. Luckily, you can isolate storage. It does not use the same gas system as memory. So, writing storage to 0x1000 is the same as writing it to 0x1000000. And on the plus side of this, it makes certain data strucutres trivial since the address space is 256bits. If you're using hashing it can make it so that you basically don't need to worry about collisions and fragmentation in some cases. \n\n## Overly simplified bytecode\n\nThe EVM's opcode set is significantly more simplified than most machines and most VMs. There are a few memory operations that act on bytes, but other than that it has no operations that work on anything other than a 256bit integer. Every programming language I know uses multiple integer sizes for different purposes. Having to explicitly cast 256bit integers to 8bit etc with opcodes results in a lot of extra bytecode being needed, and extra complexity in the implementation of the language. There are also basic things missing, like logical and bitwise shifts. Instead it relies on a complex set of AND, OR, and EXP opcodes. This additionally complicates pretty much every normal language which uses shifts a lot behind the scenes. This simplification of available operations makes the gas costs of the EVM a lot more easy to reason about, but at the cost of requiring a lot more opcodes for basic operations that must VMs and machines implement in a single instruction.\n\nSo basically, any language built for the EVM must be from scratch in order to work and be optimized enough for smart contracts and to function on the EVM. The EVM was definitely not designed for compatibility with existing paradigms and existing languages. According to their rationale document it was designed for cryptography, though that makes no sense to me personally. Cryptography is too expensive to do in a smart contract on the public Ethereum blockchain, and the EVM is too slow to do it in a private blockchain (hence why people prefer precompiled contracts written in native languages) \n", 5], ["2017-08-07 17:08:45", "If you want to properly comprehend what a smart contract is this is the beginning of a series of tutorials that can help.

He's been doing a great job over the months we've been working on it and he's currently finishing up the Alpha.  So far we have a completed smart contract (revised ~10 times, mostly by me), a UI framework, and a half-finished MongoDB backend interfacing with Infura.  I've also secured a domain and a server to host with.  What I'm looking for is an experienced Dapp developer to work with us in finishing up and polishing the Dapp in preparation for release.  The job includes heading up finalization of the backend and UI integration, ensuring security and scalability of the interface, testing standard usage as well as edge cases, polishing the design, and describing how to use the interface for the HowTo/FAQ.  I don't want to spoil the release by stating publicly what the Dapp does, but I can say it's something that users have wanted for years but didn't know was possible.  It definitely fills a gap.  For comparison, if you've been around a while, you might remember the frustration of trying to get into ICOs before I created the first ICO pool.

When you access your bank\u2019s website, you\u2019re trusting the bank, not the proprietary code running the website. \nWhen you send ether to a smart contract, you\u2019re betting your money on that specific piece of software behaving correctly. \nIt\u2019s easier to verify the behaviour of a very simple piece of code, but if the code gets too complex, the bet becomes exponentially riskier. \n\nAll of this sums up to the need for extreme simplicity in coding smart contracts. \n\nSadly, most Solidity code I see is just too bloated. Most are not up to the standards of regular software engineering. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think all us hopeless, it will just take time and some Darwinian evolution.

For example, what happens if you withdraw a negative amount? If you have 0, and you withdraw -10, it will do `0 - (-10)` which = ... ? The actual answer is 10. They now have a balance of 10. It's their money, so it's not actually an issue here, but be careful to watch out for it. Always check that any amount is positive.\n* Prefer `view` over `constant`. Constant is an alias. \n* A lot of methods are payable that should not be. closeVault, the constructor, sendPayment. IMO none of those should be payable.\n* Again IMO you shouldn't be copying and pasting the ownable methods, but importing and extending them directly. They're clearly taken from zeppelin, but then done wrong.\n* Keeping a \"balance\" of the contract is pointless. The contract has an internal balance in `this.balance` and all you do by creating a variable for it is create potential flaws. \n* Style issue, but closeVault should just be called `close`. It's a vault... every action applies to a vault so it's redundant.\n* made irrelevant by not actually using an internal \"balance\" var, but your code ASSUMES transactions processed and then reduces people's balance.

So it is pretty safe (assuming no one else has your keys).\n\nThe idea of signing to guarantee authenticity has been used for a long time and is at the heart of blockchain development.

If there are too many words **this will cause txs to run of gas** and you will not be able to start any more new rounds. Since `startNewRound` is not called manually but is a private method that is automatically called from `feedTweet` this will result in a situation where the winner of the last game cannot be calculated nor can the round end. `feedTweet` also loops over the array `words`. If there are too many words this could also the tx to run out of gas and the contract would enter an unusable state. Note: deleting words after they've been added once will not resolve this issue.\n\n---\n\n# Some minor suggestions:  \n\n`feeAddress` and `feedAddress` look awfully similar. This could lead to situations where you intend to use `fee*` but end up using `feed*` or vice versa. It would be better to use variable names that aren't so similar.\n\n---\n\nFunction params begin with an `_` in some functions but don't do so in other functions. Consistency is important and the general practice is to use an `_` for all params. While this doesn't affect functionality, it improves readability which makes it easier to reason about code and iron out any issues.\n\n---\n\nIn `becomeCoowner()` you could've used `require(msg.value >= coownerPrice)` instead of the `if () {revert();}`\n\n---\n\nIn `becomeCoowner()` rather than checking if `msg.value` is greater than coownerPrice and then assigning the remaining ETH to `profits[msg.sender]` you can do `require(msg.value == coownerPrice)` and skip assigning the balance to the `profits[msg.sender]`.

I have a couple suggestions to expand on it\n\nFirstly, it would be nice if there was some sort of archive of past proposals and if they passed or not. \n\nSecond, I think there are a few concepts to implement which could allow this project to scale up signficantly.\n\nTimed Votes which ignore non-participants.\nIt looks like the voting is based on a super majority, 60%+1.  There could be times when there are not enough active users voting yay or nay to reach that 60% threshold. Currently it looks like from the moment the proposal is put forth it has 30 days to reach 60% or it fails due to expiring. The moment it reaches 60% it is able to be enacted right away. I think there should be two ways an approval could occur. First being, 60% of the whole population and it can be enacted right away. Second and new being, at the end of the expiration period, if 60% of the participating votes were in favor of the proposal, it can be enacted. This way if there are times of inactivity within a community, proposals aren't destined to fail.\n\nRepresentative Democracy as large scale solution\nA very large scale implementation could be voting in delegates and only delegates can put forth measures such as taxation or creating money. This would be a solution to prevent proposal spam. It would change from a direct democracy to a representative democracy though. Alternatively, just upping the price to propose, but that might have the adverse consequence of discouraging participation.\n\nLast thing. Whats the database for the citizens? from looking at the source it appears to be stored in a contract. This is great for being immutable and part of the chain, but i'm worried it doesn't scale ", 1], ["2017-10-18 10:19:02", "Hey I'll definitely check it out.\n\nRelated to gas costs, some material I've seen has shown using contracts for large data storage can lead to expensive gas usage.\n\nAlso, are a lot of states being updated with each proposal? I'm only familiar with the basics of solidity but if a lot of states are being updated on each proposal it'll have high costs.\n\nOn another note. I'm getting an RPC error from RVGatekeeper \"Account creation failed: Error: Invalid JSON RPC response: \". ~~could this be related to it being the same ethereum address used in the version 1 of redditvillage?~~ Tried with a new ethereum kovan address and got the same error.", 1], ["2017-10-06 05:35:41", "Not really, then it would be trivial to spam the test network and take it down, then developers wouldn't be able to use it", 3], ["2017-10-13 05:01:24", "Hi ireditfirst,\n\nThanks for your feedback!\n\nI'm currently working on the next (prerelease) version of the dapp. Regarding your ideas:\n\n* Viewing past/closed proposals: Good idea, its going in.\n* Your new behaviour for expired proposals: Good idea, its going in.\n* Reprasentative democracy: Yes I have thought about several variation on this, such as allowing vote delegation (liquid democracy), introducing classes of citizen with different rights/abilities (could lead to some fun machiavellian politics!), but I think for the first release I will keep it simple.\n* Yes all data is stored on the blockchain. For now I will keep it on the blockchain, having to scale to lots of citizens is a problem I'd live to have :)\n\nAnother important change I'm probably going to introduce in the next version is _anonymous accounts_. Whereas currently you cannot receive or send the token until you are registered as a citizen, I want to remove this restriction, so that any address can receive and send the token. However, only registered citizens have voting rights and can receive benefits such as basic income. Anonymous accounts are still subject to taxes the same as citizens. The advantage is that a) it makes the token more useful since anyone can own and transact it and b) non-human actors can also use the token (such as other contracts). It also allows users to have anonymous alt-accounts to use for buying drugs and hookers etc.", 1], ["2017-10-19 00:39:07", "Oh hey man sorry, my Parity node filled up my HD and crashed.

However it might not be AS bad as I had thought - for example - the most expensive operation in my system is to create a proposal which can cost about 500K gas. I was assuming a gas price of 20GWEI which would translate to about 3$ youch!

We should have communicated more straightforward but we were hoping to have finished the automation of parts of the grading much sooner. As you know the exam has several stages including an essay, debugging exercises and a coding project. We\u2019ve spent much longer than we thought on making sure that nobody receives an erroneous grade and that the automated parts are airtight.\n\nWe\u2019ve maybe overdone it a bit on how much time we\u2019ve spent on that but we wanted to make sure that we\u2019re being super thorough.\n\nOur instructor and infrastructure team has been working on this whole system and process on high speed to automate aspects of the grading.

So if your grade is due you will get it within the next 4 weeks.  \n\nHappy to answer any other questions about this. \n\nSorry for both the delay and the lack of communication!\n\nI\u2019ve DM\u2019d you with timelines for your submission as well. ", 8], ["2018-03-29 22:47:28", "I have resisted the urge to post about this in the past but at this point I want to breakdown what a joke the process with B9 Labs has been. \n\n\n## 1) Grading\n\nMy cohort has now been waiting over 3 months for our grades.  The excuses mentioned in this post yesterday are the first real \"reasons\" that anyone in my cohort has been given in regards to why it was taking so long.  Any questions about this in the class Slack channel were answered with someone from B9 tagging another person who never answered. The question went unanswered even while multiple students continued to ask for updates.  After two weeks of waiting that question was answered only after this Reddit thread got attention. This was the 6th time since January someone had to ask about grades.  B9 never communicated to us without someone messaging them and never gave any real answers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy does it matter when I get my grade and project feedback? One of the main reasons you take tests/do projects is not just for the grade but for the opportunity to receive correction and learn from what you did wrong. After waiting for 3 months I doubt anyone in my cohort has this class project fresh on their mind.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition, as someone who has taught at the college level and also conducts code-review on a weekly basis the idea that these projects take so long to grade is hard to believe.  For the final they gave a starter repo with most of the files and tests already there.  Even if they resorted to reviewing this code by hand and using the tests already provided this should take no more than a week for a professional educator.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## 2) Communication\n\nEach cohort is given a Slack channel for communication.  The response rate in this channel was not professional and to top it off all messages are deleted after 90 days.  This is because even though B9 is charge $1,500+, they do not pay for Slack.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs of right now the only messages left in my cohort Slack channel are the ones where people are asking for updates on grades.  All communication/questions about the final project are now gone.  This means if I ever do receive feedback on my project I can't refer to anything they actually said about it in the official class communication channel.\n\n\n## 3) Conclusion\n\n\nWould I recommend B9 Labs to anyone, hell no.  Their excuses have been very weak and I think most of the people here are accepting them because they desperately want their grade and certification. I feel like certifications are only worth the name behind them and at this point the B9Labs name is not worth very much.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust look at how many cohorts they are behind on grades.  They refused to answer questions about grades in my cohort channel when they have still not finished grading the cohort *before* mine.  They have known for a long time that grades were not coming but said nothing.  All while continuing to signup more classes. This is not the model of a company interested in education or even doing good business.  This is the model of a scam looking to turn and burn a new batch of 'students' as quickly as possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI will give credit to Elias as he seems to be the only person at B9 who will actually show up to answer a question.  I will also say that most of his answers are misleading at best.\n", 2], ["2018-03-29 00:01:49", "Yes I also haven't received any response since october exam.", 1], ["2018-03-28 20:40:07", "Sorry to hear about that, I was looking into doing that course it\u2019s good to see feedback both ways.

I think personally if you don't have the capacity to onboard more people, you should *stop* accepting more people. Exchanges do this all the time, onboarding new customers even though they can't properly support the current customer base.\n\nThat being said, I've found the course material to be good.\n\nEdit:\n\nThat being said, I don't think there's any excuse for this kind of delay. B9 easily made in the hundreds of thousands of euros, which is more than enough for a team of competent developers to deliver the course material on time. Realistically I think the only thing that would be acceptable is a partial refund at this point for the people whose certifications weren't delivered on time.", 1], ["2018-03-28 22:57:06", "Yes, my experience has been the same right down to the staff tagging each other.

I'm also DMing you to find a way to solve this for you specifically.\n\n1) The grading was less of a problem of going through and doing the code reviews (we do this all the time for the small projects and on request as part of the tutoring). The problem here was that we had a big influx and we tried at the same time to automate part of the grading to scale our ability to grade exams. That project took way longer than expected but always seemed to be almost done internally so this is where we fucked up. We could have done this by hand earlier but we thought it would be faster to finish the automation project. That's where we fucked up. \n\nThat said, I'd love to offer you an in-depth session with one of the instructors to get back in your code and get more feedback if you want. \n\n2) I agree that we didn't communicate this well at all and we didn't address delays properly. While I agree that we didn't do well around exam timing I don't feel that our response rate for running tutoring during the course was not good. I'll DM you to figure out in more detail while you feel that way. We usually respond to questions on the course material and exercises within a few hours at most and often faster. But the Slack problem is real. Things sometimes get lost. We've now built some infrastructure to make sure we never lost a question and we'll be switching to another live chat system for everyone. **We are using a community slack instance because we have a lot of people on there. As part of the course purchase you are a member of the slack forever**. We can not afford to pay for every student forever but we want to keep building the community. That's why we are switching now but Slack has not been ideal for that. All of these things have been some real growing pains and I am sorry you were affected like this. \n\n3) I can't contest that this doesn't make us look very good right now and I'm sorry we fucked up. We're working pretty hard on making this right for everyone affected as quickly as possible and have been working on changing the way we operate so this never happens again. \n\nWe have been training developers since 2015 when Ethereum Frontier came out and we will keep doing that. We just fucked up on an aspect of the service we are offering because we grew very quickly. I'd be happy to jump on a video call with you and introduce you to all the members of our team in London, Barcelona, Hamburg and more to show you that we are all very real (and a lovely team too).\n\nI am sorry that you feel my answers are not genuine, where do you feel I am misleading?

Currently, in bitcointalk forum, some forum members offer escrow services too. Buyers send the funds to escrow, who manually sends the funds to seller once buyer confirmed the item is received.\n\n\nHowever it's an extra layer of risk. The escrow agent can lose his private keys, and forum accounts can get hacked, the hacker can ask buyers to send the funds to his own address, causing the buyer's funds to be lost/stolen. With the Dapp, funds are held in the smart contract, and the escrow agent never touches the funds and cannot steal it. Escrow agent only has access to his fee.\n\n\nAlso online transactions via Paypal/credit cards are expensive, one reason is the online payment industry is an oligopoly, hence there isn't much incentive to reduce fees or improve service. If this Dapp is sucessful, there will be competition to offer escrow services, driving down fees and improving service. Sellers pay less in fees, and may pass on savings to buyers. Having trusted escrow services will also encourage people to pay in crypto, especially if it's a few percent cheaper.\n\n\nTo use this Dapp, you'll need Metamask or Parity activated and pointed to the mainnet.

This project I am working on is named 'Lava Wallet' and it is a wallet contract that, when you deposit your ERC20 tokens into it, it gives them 'super powers'  i.e. advanced functions for interacting.  You can also withdraw your tokens at any time.  It autowraps Ether into wEth and also auto unwraps it with a method for each.\n\nHere is the repo:\nhttps://github.com/0xbitcoin/lava-wallet\n\nRight now, the 'super power' that is given to deposited tokens is an upgraded version of 'transferFrom' called 'transferFromWIthSignature'.  This method allows person A to spend tokens belonging to person B in the wallet as long as person A has a ecSignature (digital signature) from person B.  So it essentially allows you to approve token transfers offchain instead of using the onchain Approve() method in the ERC20 spec.   This method will be most effective when called by another smart contract! That is the magic.\n\nMany dapps have their own integrated token wallets built into their Dapp such as ForkDelta and EtherDelta.  With LavaWallet, all of those Dapps could all use the same single contract as their Wallet (LavaWallet) and remove all wallet code from their SmartContract.  That means users could keep their tokens deposited in LavaWallet all the time and switch between trades on EtherDelta and ForkDelta and any other SmartContract without any onchain deposits or withdrawls at all.   Furthermore, you can offchain sign for actions within those contracts so you can do one-tx actions for any action in any of those Dapps (all the Dapps). \n\nThat is why I think Lava Wallet or something very similar will be an important and evolutionary technology for the Ethereum ecosystem and will help with scaling by reducing ~20% of all transactions currently being performed by DEXes.

For example, you can submit a collection of orders to be filled up to a certain amount, so even if the best order was already filled you still have a fallback in the same transaction.

A few potential improvements:\n\n1. The [\"solution\"](https://github.com/decentralisedkev/SmartContractChallenges/blob/master/Ethereum/1/Solution/ChallengeOne.Sol) uses Solidity version 0.4.0, which is quite old. I recommend against allowing contracts to be compiled with such an old version.\n2. Although the problem statement requires it, the `owner` state variable doesn't do anything useful and should be removed (or if kept, the problem statement should certainly say what value `owner` is supposed to have).\n3. The problem statement says \"Name and Age must be declared as public / private.\" I don't know what that means; maybe one is supposed to be public and one private? Or they're just supposed to have their visibility explicit? The solution doesn't seem to do anything about that, so the requirement should probably just be removed.\n4. `getName` and `getAge` are unnecessary; the `nameMap` and `ageMap` mappings can just be made public, which will generate the appropriate getters (`nameMap(address)` and `ageMap(address)`).\n5. The functions don't have explicit visibility, which is a warning in current Solidity compiler versions.\n\nHere would be my solution:\n\n    pragma solidity ^0.4.21;\n    \n    contract ChallengeOne {\n        mapping(address => string) public name;\n        mapping(address => uint256) public age;\n        \n        function setName(string _name) public {\n            name[msg.sender] = _name;\n        }\n    \n        function setAge(uint256 _age) public {\n            age[msg.sender] = _age;\n        }\n    }", 2], ["2018-03-27 14:00:37", "Interesting idea!

Only \"externally owned accounts\" (EOAs) can initiate transactions. So the transaction that pays an account has to come from _somebody's_ account.\n2. The \"withdraw pattern\" is commonly used in smart contracts to avoid a denial of service attack. If the token contract is paying token holder's directly, a smart contract that's holding tokens could refuse that payout, reverting the transaction. This would often mean the token contract just can't work anymore. (Every time you try to pay dividends, the transaction is reverted.) So it's very rare for a contract to directly send ether without the receiving account requesting it.

Viability\n\nViability may include the limitations of using Ethereum, scalability,\ntechnical limitations, etc.\n\n\n2. Technical Review, Code Review\n\nThese reviews may include in-code comments, notes and documentation. examples in\nGitHub.

Network Effect Potential\n\nThis may include the creation of new networks, using and bootstrapping existing\nnetworks, the potential size of the network, or the scalability of the idea.\n\n\n5. Presentation of the Idea\n\nThis may includes the entire of the material provided in the hackathon, such as\nthe 1 page write up explaining the application, source code in github (presentation\nof the idea to other developers), and any demo or prototype of the application.\nAd Hoc Awards & Prizes\n\n\nThe judges additionally felt that certain prizes could be awarded, which might\notherwise not make it into the formal judging criteria.\n\nAwards might include a grab bag of shit tokens[1].\n\nThese include:\n\n1.

Yes I think its perfectly normal to have your own backend sitting between your front-end and the Dapp (ethereum) smart contract back-end. For instance, you'll probably need administrative or authentication functionality at some point, so serve this from a node.js (for example) back-end. Funny because I asked the same thing at a crypto meetup once, I drew out some different architectures, and the presenter even told me to just call ethereum directly from the front-end (using web3.js). Maybe you could do this for some things (i.e. there are many calls you make to ethereum before even submitting a transaction).\n\n2. I like having \"control\" from my own node.js back-end. Logic that precedes the smartcontract. It might not by efficient to have all data and logic executed in smart contracts. There are different gas prices associated with every bit of computation in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). I hear the critics already, \"Well then this isn't fully decentralized if you have your own centralized control backend\". Well you know what? Tough. Nothing is pure and utopian. E.g. capitalism or democracy.\n\n3. I briefly contributed to an open-source blockchain project and I'm pretty sure I saw they were saving the ethereum blockchain (or at least select parts of it that related to them) in their own database. I thought this was odd (i.e. wouldn't it be great to just work directly with the blockchain as the database and not bother making our own copies of it?) so I asked a dev Why, is it for performance reasons? And he replied, \"Yes\". Not sure if this is correct, but maybe they did this because a blockchain database isn't necessarily designed for querying ,so if you have to query through tons of data, or query faster, or not want to bother dealing with ethereum nodes, then have your own copy stored in a msqyl/postgres etc? Well thats where my mind left off in the issue. Not sure if it's right.\n\n4. Doesn't the initial index.html have to get served up from somewhere? If your users go to www.yoursite.com, that's a call to.... a back-end! not directly to the IP address of some etheruem node. Even if it did, I don't think the smart contract is going to serve some kind of dynamic index.html page to you. If that makes sense. I could be wrong. Just an inner though from a junior web dev.\n\n5. Resources/Responsibilities maintaining the backend - In my opinion, its a LOT. When I contributed to that open-source project, I saw that Solidity development is not an everyday thing. You really DON'T want to be stuck updating your smart contracts all that time. That would be very bad. I saw the smart contracts as like the data model... something that had to be thought through from start. I was writing javascript to interact *with* the smart contracts, and I definitely had to read through them and fully understand wtf was going on, but I never ended up writing any smart contracts myself. I would not equate solidity smart contract development as something as daily as say REST api back-end route development.\n", 12], ["2018-04-21 20:44:55", "Yes, writing *EVERYTHING* on a dapp is quite a challenge, and one that often doesn't make sense. Blockchain is great for having a record of transactions. Business logic processing those transactions makes sense to have as a server.\n\nI'm selling my Steam game ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/652000/Quantum_Pilot/ ) for Ethereum.

Things like messages, offers and account profiles don't involve the blockchain at all.\n\nThere are many reasons for this. Take the example of something we decided to not put on the blockchain: our end-to-end encrypted messaging system. The system is secure \u2014 every message is signed and encrypted in the browser, and we have a good mechanism for correctly sorting messages by time \u2014 however it relies on our backend. To decentralize the messaging portion of localethereum would mean:\n\n1. Putting all message texts, attachments and read receipts on the blockchain. That is a *lot* of data, and would be incredibly expensive.\n2. Users would have to wait for the transactions to broadcast and propagate on the blockchain between each message. This would be incredibly annoying.\n3. Subscribing to the blockchain directly in the browser can cause a lot of strain, especially on mobile devices (many trades are done on people's phones while they're out and about).\n4. It would no longer be free to send messages. This introduces an extraordinary hurdle for users who are brand new to Ethereum.\n5. No significant added benefits.\n\nPutting enormous data on a blockchain is often easily avoidable without impacting security, and \u2014 for the sake of costs and speed \u2014 I think it should be.

I'm not criticizing, just stating facts. Check your contracts, know your solidity. Perhaps [this message from HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14810008) is useful to you:\n\n    Just skimming through the Solidity docs, I see a lot of unwise decisions there aside from the weird visibility defaults.\n\n    All state is mutable by default (this includes struct fields, array elements, and locals). Functions can mutate state by default. Both are overridable by explicit specifiers, much like C++ \"const\", but you have to remember to do so. Even then, the current implementation doesn't enforce this for functions.\n\n    Integers are fixed-size and wrap around, so it's possible to have overflow and underflow bugs. Granted, with 256 bits of precision by default that's harder to do than usual... but still pretty easy if you e.g. do arithmetic on two inputs.\n\n    Operators have different semantics depending on whether the operands are literals or not. For example, 1/2 is 0.5, but x/y for x==1 and y==2 is 0. Precision of the operation is also determined in this manner - literals are arbitrary-precision, other values are constrained by their types.\n\n    Copy is by reference or by value depending on where the operands are stored. This is implicit - the operation looks exactly the same in code, so unless you look at declarations, you don't know what it actually does. Because mutability is pervasive, this can can have far-reaching effects.\n\n    Map data type doesn't throw on non-existing keys, it just returns the default value.\n\n    The language has suffixes for literals to denote various units (e.g. \"10 seconds\" or \"1000 ether\"). This is purely syntactic sugar, however, and is not reflected in the type system in any way, so \"10 second + 1000 ether\" is valid code.\n\n    Statements allow, but do not require, braces around bodies. This means that dangling \"else\" is potentially an issue, as is anything else from the same class of bugs (such as the infamous Apple \"goto fail\" bug).\n\n    Functions can be called recursively with no special effort, but the stack size is rather limited, and it looks like there are no tail calls. So there's the whole class of bugs where recursion depth is defined by contract inputs.\n\n    Order of evaluation is not defined for expressions. This in a language that has value-returning mutating operators like ++!\n\n    Scoping rules are inherited from JS, meaning that you can declare variables inside blocks, but their scope is always the enclosing function. This is more of an annoyance than a real problem, because they don't have closures, which is where JS makes it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with this approach to scoping.\n\nPlease understand how solidity works before deploying contracts in production.", 2], ["2017-07-20 16:08:54", "Its a flaw in the Solidity language that it defaults to `external`.", 2], ["2017-07-21 00:13:27", "That arguable, most of the functions are meant to be external so in a way it makes sense.\n\nIt'd make sense throwing at least a compiler warning when using external functions inside other functions.", 2]]}, "317": {"created": "2017-06-25 06:38:03", "title": "Valuable Truffle Tips that Cost Me About $100", "num_comments": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-06-25 20:09:34", "I can't imagine deploying a contract to main net thru truffle.

If you have a chain of requests, say you are iterating through a bunch of ids and retrieving data on each id then waiting for one request to finish before moving onto the next very rapidly multiplies the amount of time your application is sitting around doing nothing. Thats not a great user experience. Instead its is better to fire off a bunch of requests without waiting and then deal with each response as it comes back. Your application is only a little more complex: your callback functions need some data associated with them to identify the request if it is not apparent from the returned data and you need to be able to deal with requested data coming back out of order but the end result is a much more responsive application. \n\nI dont know why metamask specifically limits itself to just asynchronous calls but it is a good idea to design things that way anyway and the functionality is already there in web3 so you may as well use it. \n\nUp to date versions of web3 will also allow the use of [promises](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises) which simplify the added complexity of writing callback functions but I have not personally explored using them and so I'm a little behind myself on best practices.

In this case the store owner maintains customer's personal data via other means (for example, by having some kind of CSV file with all the addresses mapped to his/her customer's personal data). The products offered there are described in minimal terms. A product name here, a short description there, that's it. Such a store would be of interest if the owner know his/her customers very well and they need certain products only (s)he can deliver. For whatever reason. \n\nA full store would be a Dapp talking to a storage/API. The Dapp would of course behave differently according to the user currently logged on.

When a registered customer comes in his/her shopping cart or purchase history gets displayed.\n\nBut because I have almost no experience with Ethereum and/or Solidity I can only speculate about the final results.

JavaScript has turned into a full dev language and isn't just a client include for the browser anymore. I started learning node (node.js) and that is where the JavaScript change in thinking began for me. Previously I only used server side scripting languages with ajax and databases (PHP/MySQL - lamp stack for instance) to get similar functionality. I think all the recent JavaScript books teach this new philosophy now.\n\nSo, for Ethereum, I learned a LOT from downloading the MIST meteor dapp wallet and learning meteor and electron.\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/mist\n\nif you can even get that running you are getting somewhere because I found it hard the first time. After you get it running you will want to try and figure out the entry point in the code and how it all works. Well, that is where the fun kind of begins. Making some updates and changes was an extreme amount of learning for me.\n\nSo. for contrast this is just the meteor app without the electron mist browser\n\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/meteor-dapp-wallet\n\nIf it helps the atom IDE is the way to go and it is an electron app built by GitHub.\n\nSo, .....web3 - after learning all that stuff above and finally getting a meteor app and an electron app working and built I ran into web3 to get something done using ETH. In my case I couldn't get the above code to edit and be useable so I made my own meteor based wallet then posted it to electron. Electron will allow you to call the meteor app (it calls it as localhost:3000) as one of its web view components so you can actually focus on something like meteor first and get it to function just fine. You can maybe ignore electron at first for this case but it is good to know it exists...\n\nSo, web3:\n\nWeb3 has updated from version 0.2 to 1.0beta and this is another big leap. Things that work on the 0.2 version have changes slightly in the 1.0 beta. But 1.0 beta makes some things so much easier for some transactions. Most of the code you find online will be for the 0.2 version and some of it may bleed over. It's funny because the things that don't work in one version when fixed cause other things to not work in the other version....so it can be confusing. You probably want to use the infura.io api to explore the blockchain and probably a test net. The reason for this is because then you do not have the extra difficulty of understanding the running of a local node. Otherwise there are some parity and/or geth skills you may end up needing (another fun rabbit hole into the GO and C programming languages).\n\nUsing the web3 library in meteor is one option and that is what I ended up doing.\n\nIn my opinion you are entering an area where you need to learn multiple skills not just one. This has been my journey and I am just starting to get it now after a couple months. And I considered myself to have a decent JavaScript background to start. Good news is the communities are pretty helpful and don't be ashamed to ask any question no matter how simple it seems. You can PM me if you run into a snag and will do my best to help.\n\nYou may also want to explore beaker browser and the dapp protocol to take some of these skills into another area of decentralized JavaScript coding but that would be down the road.\n\nEDITED for readability because a lot of scatterbrained stuff in my previous response.", 9], ["2018-02-20 15:41:43", "I've written a few dapps with node and web3.

These are typically easier to build, easier to use, faster, more scalable and *technically* cheaper. The downside is that trusted parties are a security hole, and being a trusted party can create costs; For example, see the introduction to [the Bitcoin whitepaper](http://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) for a discussion of how the technical ability that a trusted payment operator has to reverse transactions leads to a *responsibility* to sometimes reverse them, which in turn creates operational costs that you can avoid with a decentralized system.", 3], ["2018-01-14 11:03:48", "Your absolutely right that I'm being inprecise with my verbage, I couldn't think of a concise way to say \"conventional web/browser based strategies\".

For example, with crypto-kitties you want to know that your virtual property will still be around even if the startup that created it disappears.\n\nThere's also a middle ground where it's OK to let users trust you as long as they can verify, which you can cover with a hashed audit log, and just post occasional hashes to the blockchain, which is very cheap.\n\nRelatedly, there are potentially applications where you don't want to take on the cost and/or administrative burden of maintaining an application and its database. This is usually a bad trade-off if the application is going to be doing high traffic because you take on a higher cost in complexity, and the users have to pay a lot to use it, but it might make sense if you don't expect the app to do a lot of traffic, but you want it to stick around.", 2]]}, "371": {"created": "2018-01-11 17:35:53", "title": "How to Vote Safely with an ERC20 Token \u2013 validitylabs \u2013 Medium", "num_comments": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "score": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2018-01-12 07:46:45", "Proposal 5: votes are associated with accounts, rather than tokens, and the number of votes cast by each account is determined by the balance of the account at the time the vote closes.\n\nThat is, if I vote for option A, it records my account in a list of voters for option A. When the vote closes, it iterates over the list checking the balance of each account and tallying up the votes that way.

That could potentially be mitigated by recording the state root of the token contract at the time the vote closed, then check the balances using Merkel proofs, but that would be even more gas intensive, but resumable across transactions.\n\nAnother issue here is that it doesn't allow for one account to split votes across multiple options (say I have ten tokens and want to cast 7 votes for A, 3 votes for C, and no votes for B).

There is good reason for it to be like that: the Ethereum smart contract paradigm was brand new when Solidity was formulated, so there wasn't much knowledge about what high-level patterns would be necessary and sufficient\u2014an improperly designed high-level language could have stifled innovation.\n\nIt is also hard to analyze Solidity contract systems; this has several reasons, one being that there is no formal specification of the language semantics.\n\n(The famous old phrase [\"worse is better\"](https://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html) also explains why the languages that win tend to have many flaws.)\n\n### Multi-contract systems and deploy scripts\n\nIt has turned out to be the case that most interesting dapps will consist of several contracts interacting with each other. This is both because of architectural concerns ([cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science\\)) requires separating concerns) and because of system limits (a single contract can end up exceeding the block gas limit for deployment).\n\nSolidity can of course describe multi-contract systems. However, the language paradigm treats each contract as independent, having only rather weakly typed pointers to other components.\n\nDeploying (and upgrading) the system is usually done *outside* of Solidity, using deploy scripts. This is again because of block gas limits: if you write your deploy script as a Solidity contract that does `new` on all your components, that contract will be the size of all your components combined.\n\nSo a contract system has a dependency graph and a \"dependency injection\" setup that is usually not encoded within the Solidity code itself, but in some external JavaScript or shell script. Initialization steps in deploy scripts are also like this. The Parity multisig bug was related to this.\n\nPeople talk about code being \"hard to reason about.\" Every Solidity expression of the form `a.b(...)` is hard to reason about, because an external call is a dependency on another contract, the behavior of which you must make assumptions about, assumptions which are usually not encoded within the Solidity code.\n\n### Lack of specification\n\nYou can learn Solidity by reading the documentation, but the documentation is not a specification. A specification is what you need to implement a fully correct compiler, or an analysis tool that matches the exact behavior of the existing compiler.\n\nYou need a clear, algorithmic, unambiguous formulation, preferably with numbered sections so you can say \"here is the implementation of the scope lookup algorithm from Section 4.7.2 in the spec.\"\n\nThe only way to know exactly what a Solidity contract means is to study the C++ compiler codebase\u2014and C++ is not exactly a concise and beautiful language for defining language semantics.\n\nMany languages lack a specification, and almost all lack a fully *formal* specification. There's no specification for Perl, Python, or Ruby. JavaScript does have a specification, developed by ECMA, so if you wonder *exactly* what happens when you evaluate a `.js` file, you can consult [Section 15.1.10](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-scriptevaluation) for the `ScriptEvaluation` algorithm.\n\n### Type system poverty\n\nSolidity's type system is somewhat reasonable, but not very expressive, lacking especially a way to define new numeric types. This means most contracts have several variables of the same `uint` type, which makes it hard at a glance to know what kind of value they store, and makes it easier to make mistakes of conflating units.\n\nIt would be very useful to have the ability to define new cost-free integer types: you can imagine types like `Wei`, `StakePercentage`, `Seconds`, `UserID`, and so on, denoting the diversity of kinds of numbers in a contract system.\n\n### Decimal numbers and arithmetic\n\nSolidity does not have any built-in support for non-whole numbers. The way to go for representing fractional numbers in EVM smart contracts is almost definitely *decimal fixed point numbers*, meaning that you represent `1` as (say) `1,000,000`, giving you six decimals of precision.\n\nWith such a representation you can correctly use Solidity's regular `+` operation (think about it), but you can't use the `*` operation without also remembering to divide by a million afterwards. Implementing this decimal fixed point math is not difficult, but it means that your code has to use a `mul` function instead of the `*` operator.\n\nAnd then there is the glaring problem of integer overflow\u2014which recent Solidity versions do have some support for detecting at compile-time, but still, the necessity for a \"safe math library\" is not appealing in a smart contract language.\n\nMakerDAO's contracts use decimal fixed point numbers with the `ds-math` library, at two different precisions (one for token quantities, another for very precise ratios). Its code base would benefit from built-in support for decimal fixed point in Solidity.\n\nSolidity does have a plan to implement fixed point types and arithmetic, but the plan is to implement *binary* fixed point instead of *decimal*, which is less useful for monetary calculations.\n\n### Other issues and conclusion\n\nThere's also the issue of the compiler being large, complex, and hard to audit; the issue of default public visibility; some syntactic strangeness (the `.call` notation in particular); etc. Several posts have already been written about these.\n\nI think Solidity is still a workable language for developing dapps today, but I think that the community's experiences will lead to better languages in the future, and indeed Vyper and Bamboo are two interesting projects.", 22], ["2018-01-19 07:08:25", "Great question.\n\nI think part of the issue here is that when you deploy a smart contract, you can't change the code.

So what it feels like we're seeing is a lot of developers entering the space who aren't used to this structure, and so either aren't testing their code well enough, or aren't up to date on security best practices for Solidity.\n\nSolidity is, in my opinion, a safe language to use, but it has quirks and odd or unique interactions people may not expect coming from a traditional background. If you approach Solidity like JavaScript, you'll have issues with your contracts. I'm finding that smart contract security requires a very different mentality: having to keep up to date with the cutting-edge and the changing ecosystem, as well as being incredibly mindful and methodical about the way you design and write your smart contracts.\n\nI think we'll see improvements over time with languages like Viper and Bamboo coming out, but also with increased development of tooling, templating, and testing software, as well as a growing understanding of the field.

It then overflows if your array has more than 256 entries, potentially resulting in SFYL.\n\nYou can work around a lot of these problems by learning what features are tricksy and avoiding them, but \"easy to learn how to do wrong, but hard to learn how to do right\" is not a great spot for a smart contract language to be in.", 1], ["2018-01-19 19:22:13", "Wow.

Not sure about space savings, but I remember hearing that it wasn't affected (probably due to compaction?).\n\nYes, it's to save space in storage. As I understand it the optimizer will mush consecutive fields into one slot, so if you cluster the fields that you write to simultaneously together you can save on data writes. I originally wrote it with `uint256`s but when I tested it with pyethereum I found that using `uint32`s gives me a gas saving; I can't remember if I got 20,000 or 40,000 but either way it seems like it's worth doing.\n\n> Formatting of the function signatures (namely the visibility { part is odd... That said I like how the modifiers are nestled between the arguments and the return, visually.\n\nYes, there are a couple of places where the styling is unorthodox, and I had to turn off enforcement to get it past solium; What I like about putting the visibility part there is that it makes it very obvious if it's missing. The idea comes from /u/rabbyte:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rabbyte/status/889417453058498560\n\n/u/rabbyte also left-aligns the modifiers, but to me (looking at the thing in a dumb terminal without coloured formatting) that turned the modifiers into a wall where it was easy to miss things, so I left the modifiers indented as per the official guidelines.\n\nAnother non-standard part is the ordering of functions; The solidity docs want you to arrange everything in order of visibility, which I tried but it made it quite hard to read. It made more sense to put things in order of where they appear in the flow.\n\nI think both of these things have a benefit that's worth the unorthodoxy, but it's a judgement call.\n\n> Instead of using `0x0`, use `address(0)` for clarity.

You start with Blockchain theory and environment setup in the first week. Then you progress to learning Solidity theory and best practices, as well as the most common and avoidable contract mistakes. After that, you learn in-depth how contract deployment works - which is the stage we're at right now.\n\nThe course is structured with weekly quiz sections, practice challenges, and lots of reading. They claim it will take 6 - 10 hours per-week. But realistically, to thoroughly understand the suggested readings and perform the exercises it will take a minimum of ten hours per-week, usually more.\n\nI'm no hiring manager, but if I were, a certification from this program would carry huge weight to me. There are a lot of people who are calling themselves \"Solidity Developers\" because they watched a twenty minute youtube tutorial and deployed an exploitable contract onto the blockchain.

The public key is not secret, they can both exchange the PUBLIC key over any unsecure medium and it will not affect the confidentiality of data (although you need to verify that public key is really who you think it is, but that is another issue). \n\n\nSo Alice and Bob exchange public keys, over the blockchain or GitHub or wherever. So for Alice to send Bob a message, she will encrypt the plaintext using Bobs PUBLIC key, the PUBLIC key allows anyone to send data securely to Bob, and this can ONLY be encrypted using Bobs corresponding PRIVATE key. So for typical use, the PUBLIC key is always used to encrypt and the PRIVATE key is for decryption. \n\n\nOn the flipside, we have what is called signing, I won't go into details but essentially Alice will compute a hash of the message and  encrypt this with her PRIVATE key, then at the receiving end, Bob will use Alice's PUBLIC key to decrypt the hash and verify the message has not been tampered with.  TL;DR - Public/private key pairs are linked, if you encrypt with one, you must decrypt with the other and vise versa. \n\n\nRegarding the use of SYMMETRIC vs ASYMMETRIC, this is really a design decision - if for instance, in the future you want to add sharing secrets with other people, then ASYMMETRIC crypto may be the best solution as you could encrypt the secret with the recipients public key and then can easily have access to it. However if this isn't something you intend on, then use an industry standard such a AES.  DO NOT implement this yourself, use an audited library as even the most subtle bugs can lead to vulnerabilities that disclose your cleartext data. Secondly, even with a secure library implementation, you need to be careful of which block mode you use - do not use ECB, this will reveal any data structures within your cleartext. CBC should be okay providing you never reuse the same key + IV (I've seen this a lot, also seen key=IV which is also a big mistake) and also use a H-MAC. There is also GCM mode, which is generally the recommended mode now - but make sure if you use GCM mode, that the inital counter value is never reused.\n\n\nHopefully that all makes sense and provides some context on why you are using the wrong key for encryption.

Finally, the old contract needs to be shut down cleanly and inform callers that a new contract has superceded it.\n\nThere's an example of a a token contract that follows these rules at https://github.com/wealdtech/wealdtech-solidity along with a tests that work through the upgrade process.\n\nRegarding delegatecall/proxies/routers: although these are understandably tempting, these should be considered evil to front any contract you might want people to trust.  By their nature the call targets can be swapped out at will, so you're trusting the owner of the proxy that they won't go rogue.", 1], ["2017-11-08 04:24:25", "I am very skeptical of upgradeable contracts in general, though they might have some uses.\nIn general, you should be careful that you really need your contract to be upgradeable before you try do implement it. The ability to upgrade (or even freeze a contract) introduce a new attack vector (the people who can upgrade or freeze it), and likely new bugs (given how hard to implement correctly even simple multi-sig wallets seem to be).\nI'm not saying you should not have it, just that you should think hard whether you need it or not.\nIf you really need it, I would stay clear of anything that gives special power to a separate class of users, and focus on ways of creating a new contract that inherits the state from the old one.

This leads to a number of problems:- \n\n* disincentive to hold the PETH asset (there is little advantage over holding straight ETH, the PETH asset is not leveraged like in staticoin)\n* influencing of PETH price by users, leading to\n* introduction of arbitrage opportunities in the sai system, \n* trust that the backers will not simply run away (sai holders are not explicitly protected)\n\n\n2/ Our **contracts exist**, both on testnet and mainnet.

The Sai system uses an unknown oracle and queries the price every time it moves.  \n\n6/ We implement a **24 hour delay** for minting and melting new coins, mainly because we reference a 24 hour average price (to avoid whales taking advantage of our contracts).
