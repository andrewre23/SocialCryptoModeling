If we used Secure Element we would limit hobbyist and hackers in creating their own clones, because you cannot use Secure Element in your design unless you sign a non-disclosure agreement with the vendor. By using standard off the shelf components, we make that really easy. I am aware of Secure Element advantages, but we are trying to fix most disadvantages of generic MCU in the software (see below). Also there is a blog post of a community member gbg describing how he built such clone: http://www.stellaw.info/blog/2015/12/22/i-built-my-own-trezor-clone-dinosaur-hiphop-zero\n\n\nQ: Why didn't you use epoxy like it was suggested in the video?\n\nA: I see three reasons why use epoxy.\n\n   First is to increase the durability of the device. We feel that TREZOR is durable enough even without the epoxy.\n\n   Second, to obfuscate components you are using in your design. This is not needed as the design is open source.\n\n   Thirdly, to make access to the MCU harder. If you are highly motivated, epoxy will just slow you down, not stop you. Also MCU has disabled JTAG, so there is no need to block access to MCU pins.\n\n\nQ: What's up with the side channels attacks?\n\nA: Side channel attacked described by Jochen Hoenicke were fixed by rewriting all crypto functions to use constant time. Jochen did almost all of the fixing and we've been collaborating ever since on various security and non-security related improvements. We love our community! Also we ask PIN before every operation involving a private key (e.g. generating of the public key), so even if there was some side channel attack left, you still need to know the PIN to trigger it.\n\n\nQ: How about MCU glitching?\n\nA: We did our best to protect the MCU against glitching (e.g. when we check the PIN, we first increase the PIN failure count, write it to flash, verify that write was OK, then check whether the PIN was correct and if it was correct then we reset the PIN failure count). That way you cannot glitch the PIN increase write. That said, recently, we received couple of ideas for further improvements from Josh Datko and he'll talk about the issues (and fixes we are together working on) in his Defcon talk later this month: https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-25/dc-25-speakers.html#Datko\n\n\nQ: My neighbour has an one million dollar microscope equipment and he is examining my TREZOR. Should I worry?\n\nA: No. There is a big difference between attacks on smart cards and TREZOR. If your smart card is stolen and one can read the secrets from it, you can basically do nothing about it. (You don't have the secrets and only attacker has them). TREZOR is a different animal. You have the backup so you can use that to send your funds before the attacker has access to them.\n\n   Also we have introduced a concept of so-called passphrase. If you use passphrase, you are requested to enter your passphrase before the signing operation. This passphrase is combined with the secret stored in the device, resulting in creation of a completely new secret key and thus a completely new wallet! If an attacker has successfully extracted the secret from the device and he does not know your passphrase, he still cannot access your funds! Also because passphrase does not act like password (it is not not compared against known value but rather combined with the secret, making _every_ passphrase valid), it provides a plausible deniability.

More deterministic problems, where two or more parties arrive at a solution near the same time, multiple times in a row, will have higher contention (lots of forks), and this might make some problems like transcription or rendering unsuitable.\n\nThose are the basics, and I don't know enough to go into some of the headier challenges.

Coinkite, Blockchain.info, BitGo, BitPay, etc.. are probably all candidates to support this.\n\n\n* Use micropayment channels.  Advantage is it allows a trustless way to send incremental payments without paying fees.  Disadvantage is it's rather tricky to setup and use currently... it needs deep technical understanding for both the wallet and the merchant side to work well and potentially locks up funds for a long period of time.\n\n\n* Create a service to do reoccurring payment requests... I.e. you get an email/sms etc asking for a payment.  This is easiest solution for the merchant.  Advantage is it's easy to make trustworthy and makes the buyer need to handle to payment.  \n\n\n* use nLockTime to send transactions at a future date... my understanding with this approach though is you'd need to have all the funds in the sending account already set up so the change address works correctly. Without this you may spend some of the balance at an address that is to be used in future making that nlocktime payment invalid.  A solution to this would be a wallet that created a new nlocktime payment everytime you make a payment before the reoccurring payment occurs.  This seems rather wasteful bit of network bandwidth though.\n\n\n* Perhaps in future we'll have a standard such that the URI can have reoccuring parameters like repeat=12;frequency=2;frequency_unit=(hours/days/weeks/years) so a wallet knows to track this for you and will sign payments when it needs to.\n\ne.g. \nbitcoin://1f235989343409jfd034?amount=0.11&r=https://merchant.com/pay.php?h%3D2a8628fc2fbe repeat=12;frequency=2;frequency_unit=(hours/days/weeks/years)\n\nIt's quite likely wallet's will support reoccuring payments in future and I believe there is an extension to the BIP70 proposal to allow for reoccuring payments but couldn't see it in the specifications.\n\n\nThat's all I can think of, if you know of other ways I'd love to hear them!\n", 2], ["2015-04-14 03:31:44", "nice description.  apparently you have given it a lot of thought.  \n\ni want to comment on that but i don't think i have too much to add.  you already list most of the important disadvantage and advantages.  \n\nusing micropayment channel makes it secure and does not require any other intermediary.  the fund is locked up for a long time, however.  also, it cannot do automatic payment.  the user still has to pay.\n\nusing the nlocktime require having all the funds upfront.  \n\nthe uri with wallet support probably gives the best flexibility.  but it does require wallet support.  \n\ni guess the summary is there is not yet a perfect way yet.

So, you first have to figure out what the public key might be. If you re-use addresses, this becomes easier, as the public key is exposed first time a payment is made _from_ the address, which is part of what Bitcoin's change address system defends against.\n\nOnce you have that, you somehow have to brute force the private key. That's basically not going to happen without an epic change in technology (quantum computing or similar), or unless someone screws up. The \"screws up\" scenario is really important, because that does happen. To start with, Satoshi chose the secp256k1 curve, which people much more familiar with the technology than me say wasn't a great idea (i.e. http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/18965/is-secp256r1-more-secure-than-secp256k1). Some coins such as Stellar use different curves to avoid this risk, but most don't. This isn't going to be an issue today or tomorrow, but it's certainly something that needs to be tackled.\n\nThere's also a need to make sure you understand what you're doing (this is why the general advice isn't to implement cryptography, but to use an implementation someone else wrote and has been reviewed already). Sony screwed up massively and lost their master signing key this way: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/01/sony_ps3_securi.html\n\nLastly, there's risks related to how random the private key actually is. If the entropy source used isn't random enough, it may be possible to significantly reduce time taken to brute force the key.\n", 10], ["2015-02-12 04:53:39", "About 1.6 times the heat death of the universe at our current computing rate.\n\nThere was a CCN article about it a while ago.\n\nhttps://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/explaining-the-math-behind-bitcoin/\n\nEdit: Just read your question more closely. No, you really can't. For a few reasons. For example, multiple Bitcoin private keys will hash to the same address. It's possible because addresses are smaller than private/public keys. Basically think of it as compression.\n\nIt's not a big deal because the total number of addresses that could hold a balance is so small. E.g. if every satoshi was controlled by a different key, and therefore address, you would have the highest possible 'chance' of generating a private key that corresponds to an address with a balance in it. \n\nIt still wouldn't matter. It's something like 2^71 possibilities which I believe is cryptographically secure. On top of that, you need to factor in time. E.g. You may generate a key that collides but the odds of it being an active wallet is even smaller now. \n\nOh yeah, and hashes are one way functions.

Wallet developers are trying to harmonize wallet structure (see BIP 44 and BIP 45), so if you were to store an xpriv, you'd have to make sure you're able to recreate those wallet structures.\n\nBIP 39 is your friend. It's easier to back up (just a list of words) and you can use an optional password for encryption. Be careful though, if you lose the password, then your coins are gone. The software won't be able to detect that you've entered the wrong password. It will always give you a working (but obviously empty) wallet. This can have its advantages. You can use the same list of words + a different password to create a second, third, fourth wallet.\n\nEdit: There's also a downside with xpub/xpriv keys in that it's possible to work your way up the tree if you know the parent public key + child private key.

In order to transfer any money you have to tear open one or more envelopes and move it to new envelopes.\n\nTearing open an envelope gives you access to all of the cash inside and destroys the envelope. (Note that this doesn't destroy the address. You can create as many envelopes as you need with the same address on the front.) Any cash that isn't transferred to a new envelope is picked up by a miner as a transaction fee.\n\nA Bitcoin transaction is simply a list of inputs (the envelopes being torn open with signatures proving you are the one who can open them) and outputs (new envelopes with an address and an amount).

That means that if any of your parties are able to spend that output they would be able to get all of the bitcoin in it.\n\nIn order to divide the money up you either have to have the person sending you bitcoin divide it up as they send it, creating an output for each party, with each output addressed to that party; or you have to create a second transaction that uses the single output you were sent and creates outputs for each party.\n\nIf there is someone that all parties trust then they could control the address that money is sent to and divide it up. Multisig is a better option, though, and much safer all around. Each party has a key and a certain number of them are needed to sign. When a payment comes in as many of the parties as needed work together to divide the funds. [Copay.io](https://copay.io/) is lightweight and easy to use to do this manually.

While your wallet simplifies this by adding up all unspent outputs to every address you have the key to, behind the scenes it is actually keeping every unspent transaction to you. \n\nTo send BTC, your wallet chooses unspent outputs to spend, and creates a transaction from them.  \n\nIt\u2019s easy to simplify this down to \u201cminers keep track of every address balance\u201d but what\u2019s happening behind the scenes is a bit more complex, yet that statement is still true. \n\nThey do not need to read the entire chain every time a transaction comes in because they have the unspent transactions or \u201caddress balances\u201d neatly organized. \n\nWhen a node first goes online, it requests every block starting from the beginning in order to build up this organized set of data. Whether it keeps the actual chain, or prunes it, is up to the individual.
