The 1MB block limit clearly wasn't enough.  Everyone agreed Bitcoin needed to scale.  But there was intense disagreement on how to do it.  Segwit could be implemented at a soft fork, but it was extremely complicated and represented a very large change to the Bitcoin protocol.  Raising the block size was an extremely simple change, but it required a hard fork.  Eventually, the two sides divorced, and each has their own coin.\n\nYou've heard a lot of people say, \"Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.\"  They don't literally mean that the two coins are the same.  What they mean is that Bitcoin Cash is functionally identical to pre-2015 Bitcoin.  The supply of block space exceeds demand, so transaction fees remain low and almost all transactions are confirmed in the next block.\n\nBitcoin itself has changed considerably since 2015.  Segwit brought benefits, but it also introduced a lot more complexity to the block structure.  Lightning will bring benefits, but it's a fundamentally different way to transact.  A time traveler from 2015 wouldn't even recognize Bitcoin with Segwit+Lightning.  That same traveler would see that Bitcoin Cash is the same technology as the old Bitcoin.  *That's* why people say \"Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin\".  Whether that's a good thing or not remains to be seen.  Either way, both sides have their own path forward.

Which is odd, because it took months to agree to activate segwit, and was fought bitterly. \n\nNow we have them using terms like \"bitcoin core\", and claiming bitcoin cash is bitcoin. \n\nThere is no coin called \"bitcoin core\", only bitcoin, \"bitcoin core\" is the reference node implementation.

The BCH side agreed to the NYA but then reneged and forked off anyway once they realized they could not stop SegWit adoption. You see, SegWit makes it impossible to hide ASICboost.\n\nBcash was made by a tiny minority of people with the purpose of allowing them to exploit transaction malleability in secret to make more money from mining than anyone else could. There was not consensus in the community for the fork, but these guys stood to make an obscene amount of money if they could convince people their bastard coin was the \"real bitcoin\".\n\nSo they astroturfed the shit out of social media and they were willing to say anything, any lie whatsoever, to get people to pump the price of their altcoin.

Reportedly, the wallet found the $10 on the BTC blockchain and added it to his BTC balance in the wallet.  From a design perspective this would make sense to store the private keys for the addresses on both blockchains.\n\nAs far as why Bcash was born and the bloody war that seems waged between the coins, here's one of my earlier replies on the the question.\n\n---\n\nWhy Bcash was born and / or the bad blood between them... Two main reasons I see.\n\n### Jilted Lovers\n\nSimilar to relationships people who were once very close may absolutely despise each other after some irreconcilable differences.  In relationships these are normally centered around betrails.  Same with the BTC-BCH split.  The BCH folks were ardent BTC supporters and wanted their changes (religion) accepted by the rest of the BTC community.  They didn't get consensus, but still had a large enough  following (between 5%-45%.. who knows).  It eventually degraded to threats of the nature:\n\n> If you don't accept this, I'm leaving you!\n\nWith the typical response of:\n\n> You can never survive in the world without me!\n\nFast forward to today, and the two lovers are hostile.  BTC feels betrayed that after all their time together BCH really did leave (fork).  This is further fueled by the fact that BCH did survive without BTC, makings BTCs earlier boast neutered.  And BCH feels betrayed because BTC refused to take them seriously, and put the kids through this horrible divorce.\n\n### Finance (Shill -v- FUD)\n\nIn (shady) finance it is common for someone to advocate (shill) a company that they have lots of stock in.  This works because investors buying a stock will usually cause the price to rise.  In a market with limited investors, every dollar that goes towards the company you shill is a win.  Every dollar that goes towards another company that could have gone to yours instead is a loss.\n\nIf a (shady) investor doesn't want to advocate (shill) his company, he could slander (FUD) his competitor.  FUD stands for \"fear uncertainty and doubt\".  By spreading FUD about his competitor, the assumption is that the dollars not invested in the rival will go towards his (shill) company instead.", 1], ["2018-01-21 15:59:17", "[deleted]", 1], ["2018-01-21 17:53:22", "If you hate paying $20 to transact bitcoin ude bitcoin cash", 1], ["2018-01-21 19:40:36", "This is a controversial topic that evokes a lot of emotions from a lot of people.

During decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Once an anchor is set, other judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor. For example, the initial price offered for a used car sets the standard for the rest of the negotiations, so that prices lower than the initial price seem more reasonable even if they are still higher than what the car is really worth.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", 2], ["2018-01-24 06:42:35", "Wow, that made me laugh @ birthday cake.

Transaction is still pending, with no confirmation, yet the fee I set was 50 sat/byte. It might very well to sit there, funds out of my wallet, never arriving at the destination, at the mercy of the 'miners'. It looks like transactions can be prevented to expire by anyone interested, by just re-posting my transaction instead of letting it expire. My guess is that the whole bitcoin system was actually hijacked by those that mine it, since they can keep you hostage until you pay exorbitant fees for the transation to go through. The more congested is the mempool the more money they make !!! It is out of the question for me to pay for 100 euro transferred 10-18% transaction fees. Those that keep the block at 1Mb have a very good reason to do that: They make a fortune by forcing people pay higher transaction fees that they would pay at the Visa, Mastercard or banks. Under this circumstances, it is hard to explain why the bitcoin value keeps rising as it does. Normally, the value should have collapsed to almost 0 USD, since Bitcoin is not usable! It actually has no use considering very high transaction fees, and the mechanism of keeping you hostage with the transaction 'in limbo' [suspended indefinitely]. There is also the concept of 'Transaction Accelerators' where you pay to miners a randsom fee, for them to take your transaction and let it go through.

Also keep in mind that because of bitcoins price the transaction fees are very high right now. Those alone would most likely eat up your account. Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin are going to be your cheapest options on transferring fees and once they are on exchange you can sell them for BTC for trading.\n\nI recommend that you do take at least 300 and do quite a bit of research on some top 20-30 coins and invest. The key word through the community is \"hodl\" meaning hold by all means necessary. Invest, do not trade. Not unless you have a very good idea of how the BTC/FIAT pair affects the altcoin market in general. Not unless you are willing to keep up with news daily.

If you find 5 or 6 projects in the top 25 coins that you can get behind, then you are off to a great start.

If you find yourself more interested after doing research from a long term side, then take the time to fully grasp the markets so that you don't end up throwing money in the wind on these swing/day trades. These are very volatile markets, it would suck to have you lose 20 bucks and decide crypto isn't for you.\n\n As others have said Gemini is a great alternative to GDAX/Coinbase. From Gemini you could purchase Litecoin and transfer it to to Binance, Bittrex, and Kucoin. From here you sell for Bitcoin to purchase altcoins (coins other than Bitcoin). Do not invest more than you can afford to lose and don't invest period until you understand what you are investing in. \n\nP.S Bitcoin is off a nasty bounce play right now which is why it looks \"easy\" to just watch the ticker.

We were told it was inevitable because 80+% of miners signalled support for it. Community opposition was reflected in social media and in the number of validating nodes configured to reject it. We were told that the social media opposition was meaningless echo chamber stuff. The fork was called off because of the power of decentralised validating nodes.\n\nYou start with saying that there was opposition reflected in social media, and then say that it was called off because of the \"power of decentralised validating nodes.\" That doesn't follow. The fork was called off, right? So what was there for the validating nodes to do, even if you think they would actually do anything when the fork happened? The fork itself was called off due to the opposition in the community. (And also maybe because there already was a fork of bitcoin that increased the blocksize. But certainly not because of non-mining nodes. You could spin up a thousand cloud nodes if you wanted and that wouldn't give you more say in the network. In fact, that's the whole thing that Bitcoin was designed to avoid: sybil attacks, which is what non-mining nodes are, by a loose definition.)", 1], ["2018-01-07 15:09:21", "One small correction: when two miners solve it simultaneously and broadcast it, every node that heard the two solutions forks the blockchain into two. Now there's potential for any of the two branches to become the head. Whichever block first gets a 6 block advantage is chosen as the head and the other branch is discarded.\n\nIt becomes a game of chance nonetheless if the problem is easier. Not exactly sure why it shouldn't be a game of chance but one scenario that I can think of is let's say a majority of the ledgers are in the continental US. If we have a 1 block every 1 second then there are more people finding the solution and miners in the continental US have a huge advantage.

They weren't being used by anyone to validate blocks.  \n\nAnd with no-one actually using these S2X nodes, and with the nodes that were actually in use actively rejecting connections from these S2X nodes, they were impotent, and they disappeared within hours of the S2X launch being called off.\n\n> The fork itself was called off due to the opposition in the community. \n\nThe opposition had been manifest for months.

I think we're agreed on some of the impacts of Big Blocks, increased centralisation with miners having more and more of a percentage of nodes.

The point is about who decides on further changes to the Bitcoin rules. Why vest the entirety of that power in the miners and disenfranchise the users of what is meant to be a peer to peer system? \n\nIt's in the hands of the miners because they are the ones who constantly have to invest in the network, both in electricity and in hardware. They are the **only** people you can trust with the power to decide changes. And if the changes they make aren't popular, they will be forced to change back **not because of fully validating nodes**, but because of the **free market determining the value of the currency they are mining.**\n\nAlso, Bitcoin is a peer to peer system as long as a user can send money to another user. The mining network, however, is a separate case from those who are just users. \n\n>Once you centralise the power to decide on those rules, then it's no longer a person to person peer to peer network. It's a centralised system like Paypal.\n\nLike I said above, they could change the rules all they wanted, but if nobody transacts on their side of the ledger, they'll just be wasting electricity. Users do still have all the power, but **not because of nodes**. They have the power because they are the ones that **give the currency value**. In no way does an everyday user not being able to run a node make bitcoin like Paypal, because there is no other \"side of the fork\" when paypal decides to seize your funds or disallow payments to a certain party. There would be with Bitcoin.\n\n> A user pays a trusted third party to convert fiat to coin. A user pays a trusted third party in a coffee shop to convert that coin back to the coffee shop's fiat. The transaction is processed into a block by a centralised cartel of miners which also validates that the block they mined meets the rules that the cartel prefers. Peer to peer? Decentralised? I don't see it.\n\nThis paragraph doesn't really make any sense. The fact that users have to use a centralized service convert fiat to cryptocurrency is an unfortunate situation, as is the case of vendors using trusted third parties to accept the cryptocurrency only to convert back to fiat. But that has nothing to do with the fact that then the transaction is processed into a block by miners. And you called them a \"centralized cartiel\", but Bitcoin has, as I've said already, financial incentive built in for them to **not** form a cartel for any purposes, and to instead compete with each other.\n\nAlso, you're solution to this problem is to run non-mining nodes, but as I've already pointed out, they wouldn't actually do anything to \"validate\" the transaction as far as the rest of the network is concerned.\n\n> And I don't see how it's better for the user or the coffee shop than just paying in fiat to begin with.\n\nThe situation you described isn't. But only because of the centralized services, not because of the mining situation.\n\n> Because nodes share them. I run a node, it has about 60 connections that it shares with. If my node rejects a block because it doesn't comply with the ruleset that my node conforms to, those 60 connections don't receive that block.\n\nIt sounds like you are making the assumption that those 60 nodes to which you are connected aren't connected to any other nodes themselves... But of course they are! And so you not relaying a block to them has next to zero chance of preventing them from receiving it.\n\n> Indeed. Because you have misconstrued what I said. I said that opposition was reflected both in the nodes and in social media. S2X proponents dismissed the social media as en echo chamber, so when the S2X launch was officially stood down, it would seem that it must have been down to the opposition of the validating nodes.\n\nYou say \"it would seem\". It may seem that way to you, but I see no reason to assume that myself. How do you get from \"S2X proponents dismissed the social media as an echo chamber\" to \"so when the S2X launch was official stood down, it would seem that it must have been down to the opposition of the validating nodes\"? There's no connection there that I can see, and it seems much more likely that they called it off because of the controversy **and the existence of a fork of Bitcoin that already raised the transaction capacity**.\n\nFor it to \"come down to the validating nodes\", then the fork would have to happen **and then fail because of the nodes**. (If instead we let node counts influence our decisions, it would allow for easy sybil attacks. Which I've already pointed out.)\n\n> Had these nodes been so unimportant, it seems unlikely that someone would have gone to the bother of spinning up a few hundred pro-S2X nodes on AWS in the days leading up to the planned launch of S2X. But the difference between these nodes and the nodes that were already active on the network is that these nodes server no purpose. They weren't being used by anyone to validate blocks.\n\nHere you contradict yourself. You use the fact that someone spun up a few hundred pro-S2X nodes as reasoning that non-mining nodes must be important, and then go on to say that those nodes \"serve no purpose\" because they weren't being \"used by anyone to validate transactions\". But what is the actual differences between the one running one in your bedroom and the one spun up in a cloud server somewhere that nobody is even paying attention to? The answer is nothing. They have the same effect on the network, which is also nothing.\n\nI don't know why those nodes were spun up. Probably to fake support, but I don't know. It should just go to show that non-mining nodes **don't mean anything**, and that \"using a non-mining node to verify transactions\" is a meaningless statement as far as the rest of the network is concerned. It's a monitoring tool, and nothing else. It'll let you know a consensus rule has changed if you check it, but it won't affect the rest of the network at all.\n\n> And with no-one actually using these S2X nodes, and with the nodes that were actually in use actively rejecting connections from these S2X nodes, they were impotent, and they disappeared within hours of the S2X launch being called off.\n\nYou're coming up with a lot of cause-effect relationships that are dubious at best. What exactly would \"using\" those S2X nodes mean? (And if you are going to say \"verifying transactions\", please specify **exactly** what you mean by that.) And again, rejecting connections from the S2X nodes does very little to affect anything. There was definitely still a route around the users who rejected connections from the S2X nodes. Bitcoin is not a mesh network where you can easily \"section off\" any part of the network. \n\n> The fork itself was called off due to the opposition in the community.\n> \n> The opposition had been manifest for months. Why wait until the last minute to notice the opposition? And anyway, as I pointed out, this \"opposition in the community\" was repeatedly dismissed as echo chambering. It was called off for no other reason than it would have failed because of the non-validating nodes. It would have failed anyway because the code didn't work. But at least our nodes prevented that disaster from affecting the live Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nYou keep saying that the nodes prevented it, but refuse to get into what they **actually did**. If all they did was signal support for the no2X side which convinced the S2X folks to call it off, then it wouldn't have to be nodes. It could just be a vote somewhere. And it would be just as sybil-able.\n\n> I don't think we're going to make much progress here. I think we're agreed on some of the impacts of Big Blocks, increased centralisation with miners having more and more of a percentage of nodes.\n\nNo, I made the point that big blocks **won't** affect centralization of miners because there is already **much much much** bigger centralization pressure from electricity cost and hardware availability. Big blocks decentralize the network by allowing for growth, and allowing for low barriers to entry. (With small blocks you get high fees, and with high fees you get tighter margins for smaller mining operations, pushing them out.)", 1], ["2018-01-08 21:07:20", "> They [miners] are the only people you can trust with the power to decide changes.

And if the changes they make aren't popular, they will be forced to change back not because of fully validating nodes, but because of the free market determining the value of the currency they are mining.\n\nAnd that's where we fundamentally disagree.  You could say effectively the same thing about Paypal.  You can trust them to set appropriate policies, pricing etc... because they are invested in the Paypal brand and if they implement something that causes them to lose market share, they might reverse that decision.\n\nThe trust you ask me to place in miners is completely antithetic to the trustless nature of the Bitcoin I want.\n\n > It should just go to show that non-mining nodes don't mean anything, and that \"using a non-mining node to verify transactions\" is a meaningless statement as far as the rest of the network is concerned\n\nNot at all.  It shows that unused nodes add no value to the system  But nodes that validate and propagate blocks are a fundamental part of the Bitcoin infrastructure.  You seem unsure of what I mean by validating blocks.  It means verifying that the block produced by the miner is compliant with the ruleset I have configured in my node.  If I am alone in my choice of ruleset, then the impact of my validation is only felt by me.  But if others are connecting to my node to get a feed of the newest validated blocks, then my impact is multiplied.  And if the majority of nodes on the network happen to require the same ruleset as I do, then miners mining incompatible blocks will find their blocks rejected by a majority of nodes on the network.  This balance of responsibilities is critical to the robust, decentralised and censorship resistance of Bitcoin.  And I firmly believe that it is what protected the Bitcoin from the broken S2X code.\n\n? No, I made the point that big blocks won't affect centralization of miners because there is already much much much bigger centralization pressure from electricity cost and hardware availability. \n\nYou also acknowledged that miners would see that miners run a greater percentage of the nodes, in fact, you suggested replacing my use of \"noderunners\" with \"miners\".  So not only would miners be deciding on the ruleset they chose to adopt in their mining gear, they would also have exclusive authority on which ruleset is accepted by the network - thus centralising two different roles in the same hands. \n\nWith Bigblocks, you require most users of Bitcoin to be passive consumers of a service operated by people they have no direct control over.  That's not a peer to peer model.\n\nSecond tier solutions free Bitcoin from a blockchain that cannot be scaled in a way that protects the decentralised, censorship resistant and peer to peer nature of Bitcoin.  The first offerings on this second tier also demonstrate capability for tiny charges and instant confirmations.  Something which will never be possible onchain, where people are being told to abandon confirmations just as they abandon trustlessness, decentralisation and censorship resistance.  \n\nThat might work for you, but it's not what I want.\n\n", 1]]}, "37": {"created": "2017-12-21 10:04:09", "title": "What I have learned in 3 months", "num_comments": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "score": 44, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-12-21 19:58:00", "Very good read, I follow carter thomas also.", 6], ["2017-12-21 22:24:59", "Any reccomandations in how to getting into this?

This will not happen, but it would be possible for, say, some miners to stay behind on the 1X chain. That's the chain we use now. I'll explain why they won't but for example sake - there could be two parallel chains at the same time. The 1X and the 2X chain. \n\nWhat Bitcoin Cash did was hard fork and implement EDA - emergency difficulty adjustment. It allows for a lowered difficulty of the difficulty if hashrate disappears. It's not working as intended right now but this was how Bitcoin Cash was able to lower their difficulty.\n\nIn my metaphor, difficulty is part of the guessing game. Essentially miners are looking for a number within a certain range to determine if they mine a block or not. Difficulty adjusts to try and keep the number of correct guesses at a certain rate - 10 minutes for Bitcoin.\n\nThat's why Bitcoin Cash survives beside Bitcoin right now. Because they hard forked, they have a copy of the same data from before from before the hard fork. That's why you got new coins on the new cryptocurrency.\n\nNow for 1X to survive it would need to implement replay protection - this protects their chain from transactions on what would then become the Bitcoin chain. Then they would need to reduce the mining difficulty to attract miners to the coin again. However, this is unlikely to happen because the price will tank. The market will have decided the new Bitcoin is the true Bitcoin and 1X is an altcoin. So what would likely happen is a mining algorithm change. This would make ASIC hardware for Bitcoin mining useless on the 1X chain. \n\nFurthermore, the new algorithm would be just as susceptible to new ASIC miners. In about 6 months they'd be back. They'd have to source them through Jihan Wu =)\n\nBlockstream will never do this. They want to control the Bitcoin brand. 1X is going to die and lots of people are going to get hurt following them. Their coins will still be on the 2X chain but Blockstream isn't going away.\n\nHow do you know what one you effectively have? \n\nThat depends on which wallet you are running. You would use the same keys for each chain. Replay protection is what prevents your Bitcoin Cash tx from being broadcast on the Bitcoin chain. \n\nA private key is just a really big random number. Astronomically large. It's used as a seed to generate future values - public key and address. As long as you have that large number you are cool.

Bcash, aka Bitcoin Cash, is basically a one-man's coin, although he has quite a few influential minions.\n\n2. This man is Jihan Wu. He is owner of Bitmain, a mining hardware (aka miners) manufacturer that produces most of all miners in the world.\n\n3. Bitmain's miners have a secretly embedded cheat named Covert AsicBoost, which gives Jihan's mining farms (but not his customers!) advantages in mining, which results in Bitmain's monopoly in mining industry.\n\n4. Covert AsicBoost is unintentionally disabled by SegWit, a newly activated feature with many merits that gets intensively attacked.\n\n5. Bcash was live at the same time as the starting of the activation of SegWit.\n\n6. Bcash is basically 100% Bitcoin, with SegWit removed, plus a minor modification claimed to be a better scaling solution.\n\n7. Besides Covert AsicBoost, Bitmain's miners had a secretly embedded backdoor named AntBleed. It gave Jihan the power to shutdown any Bitmain miner in the world remotely.\n\n7. Jihan publicly stated he'd attack Bitcoin with his hashpower when Bcash was being created. (He controls a significant proportion of the overall hashpower.) He also implicated he'd use AntBleed in the attack.\n\nNote that unlike the allegations about the devs who created SegWit, Covert AsicBoost and AntBleed have solid evidence and are acknowledged by Jihan/Bitmain.\n\nBy understanding who is behind Bcash and what he has done / what kind of person he is, you can draw a conclusion by yourself. This includes 1) why Bcash came into existence? 2) why they attack SegWit?\n\nBcash has few developers, of which none is well recognized, and near zero development activities.

It may have high transaction fees, but it's here to stay for a long time and its disadvantages are pretty irrelevant until this changes.

You can still use it when trading for now, until there's another option (or trade into something else).\n\nBCH on the other hand is generations behind alt coins (obviously so is BTC). There is no reason to use it. You don't replace BTC with a coin that is generations behind so many others. That makes *no sense*.

Each QR scanned is a new address to pay to and therefore maps to a new output in this transaction. When you checkout and pay, finalizing the transaction means gathering enough inputs to pay for the outputs, signing the transaction and broadcasting it to the network. The store can verified that you payed by scanning the QR code encoding the txid from your phone. They can look it up on the blockchain checking the confirmations, check the outputs and make sure the items you're leaving with matches.\n\nYou'll still have to wait for confirmations before you can leave the store with the groceries(depending on their policy of # confirms) but traditional waiting-in-line cashier checkout is no longer needed removing a major bottleneck and cause of slowness.\n\nThat said, I don't think doing this on segwit coin is workable given the high tx fees.

I also briefly talk about this in the article I linked to above, but here is a good resource if you want to know how to make your own paper wallet: https://www.coindesk.com/information/paper-wallet-tutorial/\n\nPersonally, I have the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and I have had no issues using it. \n\nYou asked what things you should consider and I would say the two most important things to consider are the reputation of the brand and what Cryptocurrencies you would like it to support. Find out what other people are saying about the wallet and whether it has proven its security during its existence. If you are just investing in Bitcoin, any wallet will support the coin. If you are looking into other alt coins, check and see that the wallet has support for the coins you are considering investing in or have invested in. \n\nHope this helps!

Firstly. \n\nI'd highly recommend following your heart on this one. _Get involved_. It's an amazing thing, cryptocurrency, and you'll be in for a wild ride. \n\nFirst, gotta figure out how to keep any cryptocurrency safe. You can use phone wallets (like Coinomi or Jaxx, and there are lots of others) to store your new crypto, but longer term you'll want a _hardware wallet_. Examples: Trezor, KeepKey, Ledger series. You can also look up \"paper wallets\" if you're tech savvy, but if not, hardware wallets are more convenient anyway. Phone or PC wallets are OK, but they're not as secure if you're storing hundreds or thousands of dollars of crypto. \n\nNext, gotta figure out how to get crypto. If you live in NYC, you might have a hard time finding an exchange to get fiat (USD) on to, but there might be a few. Could try localbitcoins.com too. Look up \"bitcoin exchanges that do business in NY state\". That will let you get funds into bitcoin. \n\nWatch out for some exchanges though, and never trust any with all your coins. Exchanges don't disappear all that often, but if you ask any old timer about Mt. Gox, you'll get an earful. Don't store coins on an exchange. In my view, unless you're doing some exotic like margin trading, you should only use an exchange to get fiat USD onto, and then buy your coin, and transfer it back off to your secure wallet. You can also use local bitcoin ATMs, which are convenient but charge a fee which is usually around 10% give or take. Check out coinatmradar.com to see those in your area. \n\nYou can see what coins are where in the hierarchy of market cap at coinmarketcap.com, and there are some others. It's a lot to look at but if you keep checking in, you can see some coins doing better than others day to day. \n\nForums like this one are a good place to ask specific questions. \n\nAlso, know that the price goes up and down. It might go waaaay down for your particular project. Some never come back up again. Big tips there in the \"buy and hodl\" game (also, people say hodl as a kind of meme-like joke about holding... someone misspelled that on a forum a few years ago and it spread) would be to *have patience* and to *diversify*. \n\nI'm relatively confident that if people buy a variety of the top 10 or 20 coins, even in relatively small amounts, that they will be up in a few years. Maybe sooner, but if you think about this long-term, you'll have a better time. \n\nGood luck!

While   network   nodes   can   verify transactions   for   themselves,   the   simplified   method   can   be   fooled   by   an   attacker's   fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.   One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block,   prompting   the   user's   software   to   download   the   full   block   and   alerted   transactions   to confirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\n\nIt sounds like he's saying that that's only an issue if the network is overpowered by an attacker.

He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\n\nBack to you again:\n\n>No, it is trivial and inexpensive to sybil attack .\n\nAgain, there's no substance to this answer. If it is trivial and inespensive, could you explain how it would work? My suggestion was that, since SPV wallets connect to many nodes, it would be difficult to isolate that wallet from any honest nodes. What data do you have that suggests that it would be easy and inexpensive to sybil attack the network in such a way? Has it been done?\n\n>No , it is impossible for light clients or even full nodes to peer to the whole network . They merely see a small fraction of the network at any given moment and can easily be segmented\n\nAlso from the whitepaper:\n\n>It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network   nodes   until   he's   convinced   he   has   the   longest   chain,   and   obtain   the   Merkle   branch linking   the   transaction   to   the   block   it's   timestamped   in.\n\nWhat is sounds like he's saying is that the light wallet can query as many nodes as he wants until he's confident.

It allows for linked-up payment channels. And payment channels have to first be **opened**, which requires an **on-chain transaction**.

As they seem to hold the same centralisation aspect, even if one of them is much bigger than the other.\n\nThe idea that BCH is centralized is a myth spread on r/Bitcoin. The potential for bigger blocks provides no significant centralization pressure (Bitcoin's blocks were getting bigger all the time **until they hit the 1MB limit**, but it was only getting more and more decentralized as more people participated in the network. And more people participated in the network because it had exceptional utility as a payment method.) In fact, small blocks may accelerate centralization because of the high fees involved in moving the coin. (The higher the fees, the fewer small miners/mining outfits can participate in a pool and get regular payouts.)\n\n>Although, I believe BCH devs are testing 1TB blocks and are hard-forking for bigger blocks aren't they?\n\nThey recently successfully tested 1GB blocks, so not 1TB yet. But yes, they are preparing for the block sizes that will be necessary to become a worldwide payment processing network to overtake traditional means of sending and receiving money. The code doesn't determine the blocksize though, only blocksize **limits**. And BCH is likely going to eventually have an adaptive blocksize limit: one that takes into account past block sizes and prevents huge spam blocks but allows for plenty of overhead for legitimate transactions taking place on the network. (You could argue that we're already past the need for that, and so having any sort of blocksize limit at all is pretty cautious.)\n\n>Also, blocks, in a way, aren't capped at 1MB as Segwit transactions can increase it indefinitely.\n\nThey actually can't increase indefinitely. They can only get up to being 100% of the transactions in the blocks, at which point, on average, the transaction capacity will be the equivalent of 1.7MB blocks. (An increase of only 70%.)

The idea of the blocksize being limited at all isn't part of the design of Bitcoin. It was always intended to function with the number of transactions getting into blocks being decided by those who build the blocks, aka the miners. If we run into technological barriers for large blocks, the miners will find a free market equilibrium where they include as many transactions as they can (because they want the fees) without too much risk of orphaning. And because technology is always improving, the viable blocksize will always be increasing.\n\n> What I meant was that because of the bigger block sizes of BCH, it must be more centralised because 1 there's less nodes than BTC\n\nFirst of all, non-mining nodes don't participate in the network in any meaningful way. So \"node counts\" are mostly a farce and can be easily faked. But even beyond that, I think that it's clear that the reason that BCH has less nodes isn't because it's centralized because of the bigger blocksize limits, it's because it had to split of from Bitcoin and is only now just getting building up adoption.\n\nBitcoin was, up until we hit the blocksize **limit**, using bigger and bigger blocks as its usage increased, and there was no centralization due to that fact. It was, if anything, becoming more decentralized every day as more and more people used the network, making the coins more valuable, increasing the incentive to participate actively in the network *via mining*. Mining has its own centralization pressures (like the geographic distribution of cheap energy) that dwarf storage costs.\n\n>2 the bigger blocksize will decrease incentive to run a node as blocks have to be bigger.\n\nAgain, \"running a node\" actually is not something the average user needs to be able to do, because they don't actually help the network **or** provide any benefit to the average user. The only people that have to run nodes are the miners and, like I said above, any centralization pressure from increased storage costs are dwarfed by the other costs associated with mining. Even Satoshi Nakamoto himself was aware of how mining would eventually work:\n\n>At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\n\nThis is not a problem for Bitcoin, it was planned for. Some businesses will likely want to run a non-mining node to accept zero confirmation transactions, or will subscribe to services that run the node for them, at whatever point it becomes profitable to do so.\n\n>Also, why does higher fees = less regular payouts to smaller hashrate miners? The pool simply calculates how much hash power a miner has and divides up the BTC accordingly - so why would it make a difference if there were higher fees?\n\nIf one miner makes $2000 a day and has to pay a $20 fee to withdraw his funds from the pool, he only had to pay 1% of his earnings to the fee, a negligible percentage. If another miner makes $200 a day and has to pay that same $20 network fee, he is spending 10% of his earnings to the fee. You can't really afford to waste such a high percentage of your income on a fee like that, so you have to wait longer for the your earnings to build up before you can withdraw. This pushes out smaller miners and gives them less influence over the pool (because they can't as smoothly switch to another pool whom they want to support without leaving unclaimed but un-spendable coin with the pool their leaving.)\n\n\n> Very interesting, although I am personally not a believer in BCH due to it's lack of use\n\nI think you'll find that, in the coming months, BCH will end up being used more than BTC. It's rate of increased adoption and usage already make me optimistic.\n\n>Roger Ver (not that I hate him, but his role in the whole thing)\n\nWhat role do you think he played in the \"whole thing\"? All that happened was that he advocated for blocksize increases so that Bitcoin could stay use-able and, when it became clear that the current Bitcoin Core development team (who has a monopoly on BTC development) had no intent of doing so and BCH forked off, he began vocally supporting BCH. That's really the whole thing. (Anyone who advocates for a blocksize increase immediately has their character assassinated in r/Bitcoin and are labeled as an \"enemy of Bitcoin\".)\n\n>centralised mining\n\nMore-so than BTC probably, but not at all to the point of hurting BCH. For the most part, miners mine what's profitable, and they can't afford to play politics. Compare [here](https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/thisweek) and [here](https://coin.dance/blocks/thisweek).\n\nAnd BCH is only several months old. As it is more widely adopted and becomes more valuable, more miners will be incentivized to mine it, and more miners will be attracted to the business of mining itself.\n\n>and in fact the general centralisation and \"undemocraticness\".\n\nAs I've said above, BCH isn't centralized by any reasonable definition. It's arguably more decentralized than BTC is at least in some respects. For instance, BTC has a single reference implementation (Bitcoin Core) that has an undue influence over the Bitcoin Protocol, whereas BCH has multiple independent development teams. If any one of them implement features that the users don't want to see, there is another implementation to switch to. (Bitcoin Core is kind of like the Comcast of Bitcoin in that they can get away with whatever they want because what are you going to do? There's no one else to switch to. Or, at least in the case of Bitcoin Core, there's no one else to switch to who has any chance of affecting any change in the protocol because they will be censored and slandered in every major online Bitcoin communication channel.)\n\nAlso, Bitcoin is money, and money is not democratic. (The idea of having a say in something without having a stake invested in the system is probably a terrible idea in general.) It should be subject to the forces of the free market and, if you disagree, I'd recommend just going back to fiat ;-P\n\n>Also the \"pump'n'dump\" side of it with tweets from major Bitcoin Cash people/companies in line with price increase.\n\nThere have been several big pumps followed by reasonable corrections, but BCH is very clearly not a \"pump'n'dump\". Good news/support for an asset tends to increase its price because more people believe it has value. Same thing happens with BTC but we're not running around calling it a pump'n'dump. (Well, many people are, and those don't understand the underlying value of cryptocurrency that makes it much more than tulips.)\n\n> If, in the future, legacy transactions die out and it's only SW, then 100% of transactions would be SW. So, how could it not increase indefinitely? I don't understand your reasoning - \"they can only get up to being 100% of all transactions in a block; therefore they can't increase indefinitely\". Surely, as the total number of transactions in, say, a day increases, then so will the blocksize.\n\nThat right there is 100% the source of all the BTC BCH drama. I would say most certainly, YES, **surely** as the total number of transactions in a day increases, then the blocksize **should** increase. **But** the Bitcoin Core Development team has **refused to increase the blocksize limit** (which was put in place years and years ago as an anti-ddos measure when blocks were only several kilobytes), and so now, instead of processing more transactions per day as the number of transactions per day increases, the BTC network artificially limits its transactions per second and builds up a backlog of transactions (in the \"mempool\"), where only the highest fee transactions get into the next block. That is a **terrible** idea for a currency, and its effects of slow confirmation times and high fees have arguably destroyed Bitcoin's dominance in the crytocurrency ecosystem:\n\nhttp://blog.zorinaq.com/assets/bitcoin_dominance.png\n\nThat's why BCH forked Bitcoin: because it was being destroyed as a currency by those in charge of the reference implementation, and they were unable to encourage a fork from **within** because those developers had such an undue influence over the protocol (not to mention that all the online communication channels were censored to their benefit.)", 1], ["2018-01-06 06:07:25", "I don't keep a bibliography as I go and don't care to do the research to continue an argument I'm not committed to.

It would be like moving money from checking to savings or doing an ATM withdrawal. Not a factor for taxes.\n\nTax rate? For sells on coins held less than a year - same as ordinary income.

If bitcoin were processing tens of thousands of transactions per second, however, it would not require much more than that X amount, because mining difficulty is changed based on how often blocks are found, which is independent of usage. The increased load on the CPU from verifying more transactions would be negligible compared to the electricity costs of mining itself, which requires its own specialized hardware.\n\nSo Bitcoin becomes extremely efficient as it processes more transactions, with the potential to easily become more efficient than other financial services, at which point it would be more environmentally responsible to use bitcoin than, say, Visa, since they've got their whole business to supply with energy, and with Bitcoin you just need the decentralized mining network.\n\nThat requires high transaction capacity though. Bitcoin has an artificial limit on transaction capacity that was meant to be raised as needed, but the current core developers refused to raise it for what I consider dubious reasons. (Are you familiar with the [scaling debate in Bitcoin](https://hackernoon.com/the-great-bitcoin-scaling-debate-a-timeline-6108081dbada)? It led to a schism in the community, with one side splitting off into \"Bitcoin Cash\", which increased the transaction capacity. Some here would tell you I'm shilling for it for just telling you about it, but it's particularly relevant because it has a scaling plan that could take it to much higher transaction capacities than BTC, which would make it much more efficient and allow it to potentially replace most financial systems in the world, causing a net decrease in energy used. This was an argument for Bitcoin Core/BTC, the one with the limited transaction capacity, before the transaction limit was reached and not increased.

Our energy needs as a civilization will continue to increase with or without cryptocurrency mining; so, if blockchain uses push forward other new technology, then we should end up in a better place in the longer term. As work is automated and aggregate computational supply increases, we will need more power for civilization for computing specifically.

It's a truly fucked-up process. Cops file some paperwork that is less stringent than the warrant process and just need to state that the property is \"more-likely-than-not\" associated with drug crime. This very nebulous standard is alternatively described as the 51% rule: If they say there is a 51% chance your house and car were associated with drug crime, they get to take your stuff.  Entirely innocent people have parked in the wrong part of a parking lot and lost their cars.\n\nThis isn't some ACLU/liberal opinion either.  From the mouth of our most conservative Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas:\n*\"This system \u2014 where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use \u2014 has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses. According to one nationally publicized report, for example, police in the town of Tenaha, Texas, regularly seized the property of out-of-town drivers passing through and collaborated with the district attorney to coerce them into signing waivers of their property rights. In one case, local officials threatened to file unsubstantiated felony charges against a Latino driver and his girlfriend and to place their children in foster care unless they signed a waiver. In another, they seized a black plant worker\u2019s car and all his property (including cash he planned to use for dental work), jailed him for a night, forced him to sign away his property, and then released him on the side of the road without a phone or money. He was forced to walk to a Wal-Mart, where he borrowed a stranger\u2019s phone to call his mother, who had to rent a car to pick him up.* \n\n\"*These forfeiture operations frequently target the poor and other groups least able to defend their interests in forfeiture proceedings. Perversely, these same groups are often the most burdened by forfeiture. They are more likely to use cash than alternative forms of payment, like credit cards, which may be less susceptible to forfeiture. And they are more likely to suffer in their daily lives while they litigate for the return of a critical item of property, such as a car or a home.*\"\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/448942/asset-forfeiture-police-abuse-it-all-time\n\nETA:  I forgot to mention that dirty cops have already stolen ***Bitcoin*** through the asset-forfeiture program, so it isn't just a crazy \"what if\" conspiracy theory - it actually happens.  Two feds who were part of the investigation that took down Silk Road, stole millions of $$$ worth of btc the seizing it and diverting some to their personal wallets. https://steemit.com/cryptocurerncy/@coinivore/government-agents-admit-stealing-silk-road-bitcoins-seized-by-u-s-marshals", 2], ["2017-10-20 03:12:01", "[deleted]", 1], ["2017-10-23 02:19:07", "[deleted]", 1], ["2017-10-20 03:15:09", "It's a point of view I guess.\n\nSince when protecting value, I don't consider just malicious actors but incidents as well. \n\nThe way I see it, what is the point to have the most secure setup ever, if it burns for example?", 1], ["2017-10-23 08:05:25", "No. I don't think you understand the process.  The person isn't notified until the police show up to take it.  You think they tip drug dealers off that they are coming to take their cars? They don't and those Silk Road cops went to prison 2 years after they took the bitcoin and put it in a personal account.\n\nOne way it happens: Oficer submits a request, similar to submitting a request for a warrant. There is no hearing. The property owner isn't given an opportunity to object or to explain.  The judge will rarely even look at the request, the usual procedure is that the judge's judicial clerk will screen the requests as they come in and check to see if the right boxes are checked. If so, they go into a pile of documents ready for the judge's signature, when that pile is given to the judge, he'll sign the documents.  Sometimes the judge will take a closer look at a few that stand out or were identified by the clerk as questionable, otherwise they get signed by the judge with less than 2 seconds of thought.  \n\nAnother way it happens: You are driving across town with $25,000 in cash in your car because you are on your way to buy a classic car.  On the way, you hit a pothole  and your license plate falls off, or turn signal stops working. Cop pulls yo over after seeing no license plate.  Cop thinks your car is similar to one that was recently stolen and decides he wants to do a quick search.  Cop finds cash and doesn't like your answers to his questions, so he says he's going to impound your car and your cash to investigate - there's your \"notification\".\n\nIf you want car & cash back, pay a lawyer and hope he can get.  Cops tell your lawyer that it's too late; the judge has already signed the papers, car has been auctioned and cash has been spent.  Now you need to pay your lawyer for an appeal.  That costs more than your car & cash are worth.\n\nBut, if you aren't going to believe our most conservative, police-friendly Supreme Court Justice, it is clear that you don't believe in the Bill of Rights or due process or freedom.

He gave a speech at \"Beyond Bitcoin\" conference a few weeks ago where he used very colorful language to push for bigger block sizes. I believe he is Australian (based on his accent).**  \n\n- What is SegWit? **It is a proposed feature (that is now going to be implemented) that helps reduce the data size of Bitcoin transactions, so that more transactions can fit in per block. Essentially it stores the signature-related data outside of the blockchain.**  \n\n- What does 80% refer to in the context of SegWit? **That usually refers to signaling, meaning that miners or nodes can show whether or not they support SegWit (or any other proposal).  BIP91 (which I believe proposes SegWit implementation and an increase in block size to 2MB had to reach 80% for a while and it did).**  \n\n- I've heard that there was a compromise. Between who? And why?  **Big-block supporters compromised by accepting only an increase to 2MB (instead of unlimited / dynamic sizing based on the market), while small-blockers accepted the increase (which they didn't want). Also the big-blockers who oppose SegWit decided to accept its implementation, except for those forking off into Bitcoin Cash (BCC)**  \n\n- What's SegWitx2? **I believe it means SegWit + 2MB block size increase.**  \n\n- What's BIP 91? BIP 148? **I believe BIP 91 was the formal name for the SegWit2x proposal. I believe BIP148 was going to be a soft-fork that would have some nodes rejecting any blocks that do not support SegWit**  \n\n- What's Lightning? **Lightning network is a proposed feature that can handle off-chain transactions to prevent too many transactions on the blockchain. Some argue it's a great idea while others (big-block supporters) often argue that it will lead to centralization.**  \n\n- There's going to be a hard fork on Aug 1st. Why???  **Because some people decided that they do not like SegWit.**  \n\n- What will the difference between the two be? **BCC, which will likely be the smaller fork, will not have SegWit implemented, and will likely push for on-chain scaling (no lightning network, but would likely have bigger blocks).**  \n\n- What's Bitcoin Cash? **It is what will likely be a new currency that has forked away from BTC (see question before).**  \n\n- Who decided that there will be a fork? Who's pushing for it? **Technically anyone can fork a currency, you just likely won't get many miners, users, or support from exchanges, etc if you don't provide enough added value compared to BTC.**  \n\n- Are most users for/against one side of the fork, or will we not know until after it happens?  **My guess is that BCC will have significantly less support than BTC. This guess is based on the futures for BCC being traded at ~$500 vs BTC trading at ~$2600**    \n\n- Are SegWit and the fork related, or do they just happen to be happening at around the same time?  **Yes they are absolutely related.

It is somewhat difficult to find an exact definition that is clear. For reference (even though it may seem like jargon to beginners):  \n>Dr. Pieter Wuille suggests that to solve this problem, the digital signature needs to be segregated from the transactions data. This process is known as Segregated Witness or SegWit. Digital signature accounts for 65% of the space in a given transaction. SegWit attempts to ignore the data attached to a signature by stripping off the signature from within the input and moving it to a structure towards the end of a transaction. This would increase the 1 MB limit for block sizes to a little under 4 MB. In addition to slightly increasing the capacity size of blocks, SegWit also solves the problem where a receiver could intercept and modify the sender\u2019s transaction ID in a bid to get more coins from the sender. Since the digital signature would be detached from the input, the unscrupulous party would have no way of changing the transaction ID without also nullifying the digital signature.  \n\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp#ixzz4o9yCPdfA \n\nThis is interesting because it sounds like it wouldn't do much to slow the growth of the blockchain since the signatures are still on the blockchain, it would just allow more transactions per block.  \n\nAs a sidenote I was surprised at how difficult it was to find an official definition of what Segregated Witness is.  \n\nFrom GitHub:\n>Capacity increase: Segwit transactions contain new fields that are not part of the data currently used to calculate the size of a block, which allows a block containing segwit transactions to hold more data than allowed by the current maximum block size. Estimates based on the transactions currently found in blocks indicate that if all wallets switch to using segwit, the network will be able to support about 70% more transactions. The network will also be able to support more of the advanced-style payments (such as multisig) than it can support now because of the different weighting given to different parts of a transaction after segwit activates (see the following section for details).  \n\nSo I guess part of my confusion is that there is data that can be on the blockchain but not part of the **calculated** size of the blocks.

This is somewhat offset by the other benefits like fixing quadratic hashing and balancing UTXO costs but the larger blocks do indeed have a cost. \n\n>Anyway /u/bitusher thank you for correcting me and apologies if I came off as rude.\n\nNo problem. I respect your humility in being open minded to change your opinion when presented with new data . \nPart of the problem is there has been an active campaign to misinform users with the express intent to show that core devs are unwilling to compromise and segwit isn't a blocksize increase when it clearly is.\n\nThanks again for helping new users.\n\nCheers.\n", 3]]}, "93": {"created": "2013-11-19 11:55:29", "title": "Is is still advantageous to get into bitcoins now?", "num_comments": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "score": 27, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2013-11-19 21:20:03", "Bitcoin's future is either pennies or ~$10,000 (or more) a bitcoin.

One of the most critical parts of every wallet is the random number generator and we have no access to the code of that in the ledger. If that part was weak, the ledger could generate predictable seeds, which may allow anyone with insight into the predictability guess seed phrases of ledger users.\n\nBut that is a pretty known attack vector and I am comfortable with trusting the secure enclave chip manufacturer and ledger that they made sure that part is secure.\n\nI am comfortable with that because Ledgers interests and my interests are aligned. Their business depends on their hardware being secure and people trusting them. If they break it by adding something malicious to it, their entire business will die.\n\nWith Trezor you have an essentially unlimited list of counter parties you need to trust, such as every employee who has access to manufacturing or shipping; Customs agents; the courier, your postman, your neighbor who could intercept your mail, your parents, your girlfriend...

SHA-256, the algorithm used to mine Bitcoin, is a one way function. That means that you can pre-compute all the possibilities without running it, which what gives a quantum computer it's power. \n\nThere are two main flavors of encryption at play in Bitcoin:\n\n1) Hashes - Bitcoin uses SHA-256 and RIPEMD as hashing algorithms. This generates new blocks, hides an address from the public key, and allows some checksums.\n\n2) ECC - This is the public/private key pair that lets you sign and prove you own your Bitcoin.\n\nECC is vulnerable to a quantum attack, but you'd need the public key. Since the public key is protected by the hashing algorithms, which are thought to be quantum resistant, simply using change addresses and always emptying all inputs in a transaction sufficiently protects your coins.\n\nYou are only at risk if you don't use this default behavior, which has been part of wallets for years now.", 7], ["2017-12-30 09:51:50", "As a note, I'm on the [Quantum Resistant Ledger](https://theqrl.org) team over at r/qrl and [discord](https://discord.gg/yA2vjU6).\n\nIf you're curious about what a quantum computer can do to bitcoin, along with the state of quantum computing, the goto paper is [Quantum Attacks on Bitcoin and how to protect against them](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf). It's kind of a long read, but it's going to provide the best summary.\n\nThe tl;dr of it is:\n\n- Really don't need to worry about mining  \n- ECDSA (specifically secp256k1) is what we need to worry about due to quantum computers ability to factor large numbers via something like [shor's algorithm (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUwZZaI5u0c) \n- The paper suggests we have until 2027\n\n**For mining**\n\n> Our findings can be summarized as follows:  Using Grover search [Gro96], a quantum computer can perform the hashcash PoW by performing quadratically fewer hashes than is needed by a classical computer.  However, the extreme speed of current specialized ASIC hardware for performing the hashcash PoW, coupled with much  slower  projected  gate  speeds  for  current  quantum  architectures,  essentially  negates this quadratic speedup, at the current difficulty level, giving quantum computers no advantage.  Future improvements to quantum technology allowing gate speeds up to 100GHz could allow quantum computers to solve the PoW about 100 times faster than current technology.\n\nRight now gate speeds are 0.04 Ghz but they're doubling every year. So yeah, not going to really pose a threat to mining as it stands currently.\n\n**For general use (ie. Public Keys)**\n\nAs was mentioned before, when you send a bitcoin transaction you produce a public key from which your private key can be derived. This is **very** hard on a classical computer because it struggles with answering \"given an integer N; get it's prime factors\". For quantum computers, it's possible to run [Shor's algorithm](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse599d/06wi/lecturenotes11.pdf), though there's [competing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.6758.pdf) algorithms and [work to optimize shor's](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/352.pdf) (the paper doesn't cover this)\n\nThe paper suggests 3 ways funds could be compromised. I'll list one as it's the most likely.\n\n> (Reusing addresses) To spend bitcoin from an address the public key associated with that address must be revealed.  Once the public key is revealed in the presence of a quantum computer the address is no longer safe and thus should never be used again. While  always  using  fresh  addresses  is  already  the  suggested  practice  in  Bitcoin,  in practice this is not always followed.  Any address that has bitcoin and for which the public key has been revealed is completely insecure.\n\nThis would allow the attacker some time to reveal the private key from your public key, and is the most likely of scenarios because of this. The first quantum computers capable of revealing your private key would likely take days to do so, so the time is necessary.\n\nI hope that gives a good overview of things.

", 3], ["2018-02-04 23:09:37", "Below are some options for fiat-to-crypto exchanges. \n\n**Coinbase** is the absolute easiest and no-hassle way to invest U.S. dollars into bitcoin. It is the industry-leader for new bitcoin investors and is well-funded, regulated, and insured. It offers a familiar bank-like interface. If you want to buy bitcoin with a credit or debit card, Coinbase offers one of the lowest fees around.\n\n**Gemini** is my favorite overall exchange. It is my top recommendation for new bitcoin investors who want lower costs and some additional features, but without the complication of a full-scale exchange interface. Gemini\u2019s user interface is clean, zippy, and simple to use. I love the 0.25% trading fees, free withdrawals, and instant access to funds from ACH transfers. Gemini also prides itself on security and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations.\n\n**GDAX**, a companion site to Coinbase, is my choice for new bitcoin investors with a trading background who want a traditional currency exchange experience. GDAX\u2019s trading screen includes a price chart with technical analysis tools, order book, trading history, and summary of open orders. Users can set market, limit, and stop orders, as well as engage in margin trading.\n\n**Bitstamp\u2019s** instant order feature for one-click bitcoin purchases  is even easier to use than Coinbase.  It also supports credit and debit card purchases. Bitstamp\u2019s EUR support makes it an awesome exchange for Europeans or any person who wants to an easy way to purchase bitcoin along with a full-scale trading interface on the side. Bitstamp has free withdrawals and I appreciate it that Bitstamp does not store your credit card information in your account settings.\n\n**Coinmama** is an excellent service because it is focused on doing one thing extremely well \u2014 purchasing bitcoin with a credit/debit card. As a result, Coinmama has the cleanest and most simple front page interface to convert U.S. dollars into bitcoin. If you plan to immediately withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange to your own bitcoin wallet, Coinmama is a great choice because it automates that process.\n\nYou can learn about the pros and cons of all these exchanges from [the Beginner\u2019s Guide to Choose a Bitcoin Exchange](https://cryptospaceguides.com/beginners-guide-choose-bitcoin-exchange/) at Crypto Space Guides.

Binance limits the number of decimal places you can use depending on the coin you are trading.\n\nHitBTC is good also. But, if I remember correctly,  it has the same issue as Binance.\n\nBitstamp is good also. Although I have never tried this, you can deposit funds from your bank into Bitstamp. And, after the transfer is complete, buy with it. The transfer can take a few days.\n\nI find Poloniex and Kraken more difficult to use.\n\nWhatever exchange you choose, make sure that your coin has good volume on that exchange.

Now, we have (much or most of the time) more than 1MB worth of transactions every 10mins, which means blocks are full.  \n\nTo deal with this, Core updated the mining code so the highest fee transactions get mined first.

This adds some new transaction formats that allow transaction data to be stored separately from the block.  SegWit also enables future 'sidechains' such as Lightning Network, which will allow numerous small transactions to happen outside of Bitcoin and then have one main Bitcoin settlement at the end.  Bitcoin-Core developers have strongly supported SegWit and Lightning, and are convinced it's the best and safest way to scale, and removes the need for any block size limit increases.  \n\nA large majority of miners and Bitcoin companies support a proposal called SegWit2x.  Currently over 90% of all miners are signalling support for 2x.  Under 2x, the block size limit will increase in a couple months in addition to SegWit.  Core is against this and is trying to prevent it.  It remains to be seen whether it will happen or not.  \n\nThere are also a smaller group of people who feel SegWit is a bad idea.  They did an *intentional hard fork* on August 1, and split off the Blockchain into a new chain called Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is now a separate currency, different from Bitcoin in that it has no SegWit but does have a block size limit of 8MB, meaning lots of space for everyone's transactions.

I think there are a handful of very very smart people who all think that their strategy is the best one and thus don't want to compromise, and a whole LOT of fanboys on each side who are happy to bring accusations of misdeeds into the mix.  \n\nBut I also think most of the actual users lie somewhere in the middle.  That's why SegWit2x was approved and implemented so quickly- because the majority of actual *users* said 'we just want this to work and make Bitcoin reliable and cheap again, so let's do both of your plans, and see which one ends up working better'.  I think that's a perfectly good compromise, and from what I can tell almost everyone in the community except a loud minority on the fringes of each side supports it.  \nIf Lightning Network and SegWit work as well as Core says they will, it'll usher in a new era of digital payments and nobody will care about on chain transaction fees.  If not, a block size increase will keep Bitcoin working in a useful manner for a while longer.  Either way, the users win.  ", 11], ["2017-08-23 21:49:00", "Sort of. \n\nAny change to consensus rules (including changing the 1MB limit) is a hard fork- that is, anyone who upgrades will be incompatible with anyone who doesn't upgrade.  Thus, most proposals for a 'hard fork increase' (remove or change the 1MB limit) have some kind of fancy activation method to ensure that most or all people are running upgraded software before the rule change activates.  That way even though it's a hard fork, hopefully it doesn't actually split the network in two.  \n\nBitcoin cash was an intentional split, that is a hard fork with the express goal of splitting the network in two.  So Bitcoin Cash added *replay protection*- extra code to make sure Bitcoin Cash transactions would be invalid on the Bitcoin chain, and vice versa.  That way you don't create a Bitcoin transaction and end up spending your Bitcoin Cash also.  So Bitcoin Cash is now a totally separate currency.  \n\nSegWit2x is a hard fork increase (IE, the 2x part changes consensus rules making it incompatible with non-upgraded software), but the goal is to maintain Bitcoin as one currency rather than create a split.  Thus it has a miner vote activation- once a certain percentage of the last 1000 blocks signal support for SegWit2x, the proposal locks in and a countdown starts.  Once that countdown ends, the 2x part activates and the block size limit is raised to 2mb.  The countdown in theory gives everybody time to upgrade, so hopefully nobody gets left behind.  \n\nComplicating this slightly, the Bitcoin-Core developers have encouraged people NOT to run SegWit2x.  Now that SegWit (their preferred technology) has locked in, they are happy and they don't want to do a hard fork increase.  That complicates things because right now about 91% of the blocks that come out are voting for 2x, meaning that the hard fork increase may well happen without their approval.  \n\nThe hope (among miners who support 2x) is that they will realize the community and miners really want a hard fork even if they don't, and will eventually add the 2x code to Bitcoin-Core.  The risk however is that they won't- that they will declare that everyone running SegWit2x is 'not running Bitcoin' and they will go off and do something else.  This would be bad for everybody, because the Core devs are a group of extremely talented coders and cryptographers and it would be a real loss if they were to leave.  However at this point it seems 91% of the miners feel SegWit2x should be the future of Bitcoin, so there may be somewhat of a confrontation.  ", 3], ["2017-08-23 05:42:38", "Sure.\n\nWhen you create a transaction, you choose how much fee to include with that transaction.  You can include a giant fee or you can include no fee.  Some wallets don't expose this choice to the user though.  \n\nHowever the amount of fee you do (or don't) include influences miners because transaction fees are paid to miners.  If you put a high fee, miners will prioritize your transaction to go into the next block because your transaction is valuable to them.  If you put a low fee or zero fee, then miners will fill their blocks with other people's transactions that have higher fees and thus are more profitable for them.  \n\nThe way you estimate a transaction fee, is you look at the last several blocks and check how much fee each transaction paid vs how long those transactions were sitting in mempool (where transactions that have been submitted but haven't yet been confirmed in a block sit).  From there you can see like 'A fee of X or higher usually gets confirmed in the next block, a fee of Y usually gets confirmed within 2-3 blocks, and no blocks seem to contain transactions with fees below Z'.  \n\nSo /u/amatorfati is correct, in that you can choose to pay whatever you want.  But since miners can choose to confirm your transaction in a block or not, it's an open market.  \n\nWhen blocks get full, that means there's more demand (mempool transactions) than there is supply (block space).  That leaves a lot of extra transactions sitting in mempool.  In a sense, you are bidding against other transactions for space in the next block- highest bids get into the block and are confirmed, lowest bids get left behind and may eventually be dropped.  \n\nThat's why fees go up when blocks are full- think of it like a bus that has 20 seats and 50 people want to get on, so the driver says 'okay the 20 people who paid the most for their tickets can get on, the rest have to wait for the next bus and try to get on that'.  ", 13], ["2017-08-24 07:21:30", "To understand this, it's helpful to understand how transactions and balances work.  \n\nA Bitcoin wallet consists of an address (to receive funds at) and a private key (to authorize the spending of any funds received at the wallet address).  \n\nThe Blockchain itself is really just a ledger system- a record of transactions and the digital signatures that authorize them.  \n\nSo when I send you Bitcoin, I create a transaction that says I am sending ____BTC from my address to your address, and I then sign that transaction with the private key associated with my BTC address.  (It's a little more complex than this, but this is the general principle).  When I submit that transaction to the Bitcoin network, nodes that receive it first look through the Blockchain to make sure I actually *have* that much Bitcoin to send you.  They can verify this because in the blockchain is the transaction(s) that sent Bitcoin to me, and the transaction(s) that sent Bitcoin to those people, etc etc all the way back to where each Bitcoin was mined.  So you could trace the history of a Bitcoin all the way from when it's created by a miner, to how it got into my wallet, and verify the signatures of each step.  \n\nTHAT is what gives me a balance to send to you- the fact that the Blockchain has a recorded history of people sending me money.  \n\n------\n\nWhen the Bitcoin Cash split happened, they didn't start from scratch.  They incorporated the entire Blockchain from the Genesis Block in 2009 all the way up to August 1 2017, and then started building their own new blocks on top of that.  \n\nTherefore, **if you've received Bitcoin prior to 8/1/2017, the transaction that sent you that coin also exists on the Bitcoin Cash chain, and thus you also have Bitcoin Cash.**  You can spend it the same way on either side of the fork (Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash), just generate a transaction, sign it with your private key, and submit it.  \n\nBitcoin Cash changed the transaction format slightly, to ensure that transactions from the Bitcoin network don't cross over to the Bitcoin Cash network and vice versa.  \n\n------\n\nHowever the two chains are now totally separate.  Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin are each their own currency.  You can trade them against each other using an exchange, just like you can trade between Bitcoin and USD.

Previously, transactions with fees would just build up in mempool and would confirm eventually, however once blocks started to be full that was no longer sustainable so Core released an updated that gave even more priority to higher fee transactions and also threw away transactions from mempool after they hadn't confirmed for a while.

When used by academics, an arbitrage is a (imagined, hypothetical, thought experiment) transaction that involves no negative cash flow at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. For instance, an arbitrage is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy low and sell high.\n\nIn principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in statistical arbitrage, it may refer to expected profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative).\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", 2], ["2018-01-02 06:33:36", "Wow.

I'll assume you just want a basic gist of it.\n\nSo to explain how bitcoin works first you just think how a bank or a clearing house works. If I send you money, then there are two parties in this transaction there's the sender and there's the receiver. But you and I don't know each other and therefore cannot trust each other. So what we do is we go through a bank. I send money to the bank which then deposits it into your account. So there is a 3rd party in this transaction you and I don't trust each other therefore we agree to use a 3rd party we both trust. Now the bank has a ledger, which is just a record of all the transactions; which account has how much money, from what account to what account etc. Which means that the bank controls that ledger.\n\nThere are two really major problems (and an inconvenience) here which you've probably already guessed. \n\n1. You still need to trust another party \n2. Since the bank controls the ledger, they may abuse that power\n3. We need to involve a 3rd party in our transaction (which, ignoring the first 2 issues is really just an extra hassle in itself)\n\nBitcoin very elegantly solves all of these problems. It allows a digital currency to be completely p2p, without trust and without 3rd parties. It does this via the blockchain. Rather than having one, monolithic, centralised, trusted institution that controls the ledger, bitcoin solves the problem by making the ledger public and giving everyone a copy. So you replace the 3rd party with the blockchain, and you don't even have to trust the blockchain since its public anyway. The blockchain is decentralised and distributed no one entity controls it, and there are loads of copies of it.\n\nSo in bitcoin there is no need for third parties. There is only the blockchain, and no one controls the blockchain. The blockchain itself is controlled by a set of mathematical algorithms which are programmed in to the core code, and again the core code is public and can be audited by anyone who knows code.\n\nBitcoin \"mining\" is the process that maintains the blockchain. The blockchain is exactly that; a block chain. Like a digital stack of legos. Every 10 minutes or so, all the transactions that happened since the last block get bundled up into a new block, and that block gets added to the blockchain, and then about 10 minutes later the next block is added on top. So every 10 minutes the blockchain updates, and all the copies of the blockchain all over the world agree on the current state of the blockchain, so all the transactions of the last 10 minutes get accepted into the historical record and are now, for all practical purposes, unalterable.\n\nWhat the miners are trying to do is solve a mathematical problem which does the job of validating the next block. This verifies that all the transactions to be included in that block are genuine (i.e. no double spends etc). A miner wins the race and solves the block, the block gets included in the chain and the miner that won is rewarded with a payout of 25 newly minted bitcoins. \n\nThe only way to hijack the blockchain is to, by sheer weight of processing power, overwhelm the combined efforts of all the miners chasing the next block. As of 2015 that's something like 10 times the top 500 supercomputers, combined, and even if you somehow could do it you could not do it covertly, so within 10 minutes someone would see what you were doing and the jig would be up.\n\nAs for how it works at the basic user level you essentially have two codes. You have a public address on the blockchain (like an email address). That code is how people send you money that's the code you give out to people. That code is strictly one way it only allows bitcoins in not out. The other code you have is called a private key. That's the secret code that allows you to get the bitcoins out again it is the private key that authorises transactions. Holding the private key (which is held in a \"wallet\". Common misconception wallets don't hold bitcoin they hold the keys to the bitcoin) is your proof of ownership. How it actually does this under the hood is via something called elliptic curve cryptography you can read the white paper if you are mathematically inclined.\n\nThat is what makes bitcoin semi-anonymous there is no identity tied to this. Its just codes. Its not \"registered\" to my full name and address in a database somewhere. I can create a new wallet for every transaction if I want. So there is nothing sensitive in a bitcoin transaction. I authorise the transaction with a private key (which is not transmitted) and the bitcoins move out of one address to another, and that's it. That's all the information contained in a bitcoin transaction; where from, where to, and how much. No names, no addresses, no private keys. Just from this address to this address and x amount. This is not shady this is security it means with bitcoin you cannot be a victim of identity theft because there is nothing worth stealing in a bitcoin transaction it doesn't tell you anything of use or value. That's why they can be broadcast on a public network, it just doesn't matter its not sensitive information.\n\nAnyway I hope that helps I know it was long but if you have any questions just post here I'll answer them if I can.", 22], ["2015-02-06 20:11:15", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0oDDIy0P2s", 3], ["2015-02-06 22:12:09", "This article?

Your first question doesn't really make sense.\n\n1.5. Private and public keys are mathematically linked numbers, but you cannot derive a private key from a public key. They are linked in such a way that knowing the private key and a certain set of data, you can generate a number, a signature, that should only be possible to generate using the private key. This signature is also tied to a certain set of data, in this case, a transaction, if the data is changed, the signature is not valid for that new data. The validity of the signature is checked by doing some fancy math with the public key and the signature, upon which the algorithm should spit out a specific result, if it does, this means that the signature is authentic from the holder of the private key.\n\nBitcoin is sent to a bitcoin address, which is just a bit of a modified public key. Upon presenting a valid signature for a transaction, bitcoin is sent to the next recipient listed in the transaction. No, you do not need a new address/private key for each transaction, it is just common practice because there is no real reason not to generate a new address/private key for each transaction and it allows for more privacy where people can't see your total balance.\n\n2\\. Not all the coins have been mined, the mining incentive in the future as all the coins are mined will be the transaction fees tied to each transaction.\n\n3\\. Only the miner (people who do proof of work) gets the reward, although these days there are things called mining pools, where many people mine for one individual who distributes the reward based on the amount of work they are contributing to mining. Nodes get no reward unless they do proof of work, but they do help move transactions through the network to hopefully reach the miner who will mine the next block. This is a volunteer position, though many miners also run nodes because it is in their economic interest to have bitcoin work well.\n\n4\\. What do you mean? Same way a computer checks the size of a file, it just reads the file and counts the bytes. \n\n5\\. Closer to this.\n\nI take the hash of the previous transaction (known as an input) add the recipient addresses and how much they all get, hash that, then sign the signature, then publish all of that together. The hash of the previous transaction is used to refer to a previous transaction showing that you got BTC, making it easier to parse through the blockchain and find the transaction in question, which proves the amount you have. Sure you could check the signature of the previous transaction as well, but that is already been done before when downloading the blockchain, so doing it again is redundant. \n\n6\\. Until a transaction makes it into a valid block, the transaction is considered unconfirmed and somewhat reversible if the sender is malicious and the sender sends out a new transaction sending the bitcoin elsewhere. The network tends to reject this second transaction, making it difficult for it to get to a miner and making the first transaction more likely to be valid, but there is nothing stopping a miner from putting in the second transaction into the block beside the fact that it may be difficult for the transaction to reach them.\n\n7\\. What do you mean by \"nothing is spent?\"\n\n8\\. Proof of work is a random event, for each try you have a 1 in quadrillion chance of finding a valid proof of work solution. This means that the faster your hardware, the faster you will find solutions, but that doesn't mean that the fastest hardware will always get the valid solution before the others. There is no such thing as \"progress to a valid solution.\" That being said, non-proof of work nodes are mainly volunteers, but miners have an economic interest to keep bitcoin up and running and as do many bitcoin holders, so they will run nodes for free, its not like it costs them much. \n\n9\\. Only a spent transaction is trimmed from the merkle tree, I sent you bitcoin, the transaction will only be trimmed once you spend that bitcoin. The network checks that your transaction is valid and once accepted, there is no reason to keep that old transaction in the blockchain and as a result it is trimmed and replaced by a hash. At least in theory. While bitcoin clients do have trimming capabilities, these days the blockchain is small enough that trimming is not absolutely necessary. \n\n10\\. If by memory you mean hard drives, yes, if by memory you mean RAM, no. \n\n11\\. Yes you do, although many \"light clients\" get away with not downloading the blockchain by trusting a third party in sending them correct info from the blockchain upon request.\n\n12\\. Maybe, if you send out a transaction and in the next 5 seconds, a miner puts your transaction in and finds a valid block, then it took 5 seconds, but on average, a batch of transactions is validated every 10 minutes. There is however no guarantee that a miner has to include your transaction in the next block and if they don't, you have to wait till the next block to see if they included your transaction again. Yes, this is a bit slow, ethereum has a bit of an interesting solution that allows it to have 15 second block times but that is for another time. Ethereum's value lies elsewhere though. \n\nAnyways, yes, the window can be annoying, there is a solution coming soon that can potentially fix this known as a Lightning Network. \n\n13\\. Sure, assuming that computing breakthrough is big enough, but the chances of that are unlikely. \n\n14\\. It is very rare for a fork to happen when a block is \"orphaned.\" But the general rule is that if it is less than 1 bitcoin, you can generally trust it when a new valid block comes along, if it is more, wait 3 or so blocks. \n\n16\\. It fits the criteria for a currency so I say it is.\n\n17\\. You got everything it seems, congrats, it took me much more than just reading the whitepaper to get all this. If you still have questions, ask. That being said, if you really want to, go read the book \"Mastering Bitcoin,\" and go binge the bitcoin wiki. \n\n18\\. No, you are not too late to jump in.\n\n19\\. A currency's real world use is the most important property of it, since Bitcoin is already the most widely accepted, it should keep ahead. That being said, I do like the ideas that things like Ethereum have. ", 15], ["2017-08-15 08:59:30", "1) One of the key features of Bitcoin is that the entire ledger can be inspected by anyone.  Addresses *must* be public so that anyone can see transactions into and out of those addresses.  To validate digital signatures the public keys must be known.  That's the nature of elliptic key cryptography.  \n\n1.5)  The private key is just a random number, so big that nobody could ever guess it.  It gets used to compute the corresponding public key.  The private key allows you to create a digital signature to be included with a transaction, proving that someone who knows the private key consented to the transaction.\n\n2) Not all of the coins have been mined.  In addition to new coins being mined, miners also receive the transaction fee from each transaction.\n\n3) Nodes receive zero compensation for anything, but running a node is the only fully trustless way of using Bitcoin.  Bitcoin-based businesses almost all run their own node(s), in addition to many who run nodes altruistically.  Miners, who may or may not run nodes, receive compensation for confirming transactions (which is only one of the ways that transactions are checked for validity--anyone can see if a transaction lacks the proper signature or is trying to spend coins that don't exist, but only miners can protect against a double spend).\n\n4) Miners are given complete authority to include any number of valid blocks, but there's a limit on how much data they are allowed to put into a block.  They may use any criteria they choose.  There are a lot of miners, though, and most will prioritize transactions based on the fees paid per byte of data used, thereby maximizing the fees the miner collects while filling the block.  \n\n5) Your sequence is a mess.  Throw that whole thing out; not all of it is necessarily wrong, but it's easier to start fresh.  Let's look at a real transaction and step through it. I'll use [this](https://blockchain.info/tx/0100b5379ad7e833fd2d49421d9ad8c3e283ce15a06d5d949762dda7bdb2fc5f) one, which I chose as a random recent transaction.\n\nA transaction has inputs and outputs.  The inputs have to be enough to cover the outputs.  In this transaction there's one input (from 137eLh3..., for 0.05448565 BTC), and two outputs (to 1B2x7w... for 0.04733374 BTC and to 1DUb2Y... for 0.005 BTC).  The input(s) are outputs from previous transactions which have not been spent yet.  You can click on the 137eL... address and see the transaction that created that input.  In this way you could trace any transaction back to one or more mining transactions, which are allowed to have outputs greater than their non-existent inputs.\n\nIf you do the math you'll notice that 0.04733374 + 0.005 is not 0.05448565.  The difference between these is the fee that the sender paid. \n\nThe sender for this transaction knows the private key for the 137eL... address.  The receiver told the sender the address to send to (probably 1DUb2Y..., but perhaps 1B2x7w...; we can only guess which one).  The sender then put together the transaction naming the unspent output that would be spent and specifying the outputs that the transaction should have.  Since the input doesn't exactly equal the amount they're intending to spend (presumably 0.005 BTC) they send the rest to a new address, called a change address.\n\nThe sender is then required to make a digital signature of the entire transaction.  They have to make a signature for each of the inputs they used.  Technically they have to supply a solution to the challenge that was set up when the input was created as an output of a prior transaction.  Almost all transactions use the challenge of \"provide a public key that hashes to this value, then provide a signature of the transaction using that public key's private key.\"  Bitcoin transactions have a remarkably rich scripting language implemented in them, even though most transactions don't use it.\n\nAt that point the sender presumably chose to never use the 137eL... address again--there's no need to.  They can easily just generate a new private key and a corresponding addresss.  If they reused that 137eL address again then someone could start trying to connect the dots between those transactions.  By not reusing the same address they make that task harder. \n\n*******\n\n6) No problem with that.  There's always a pool of unconfirmed transactions.  When a miner bundles a bunch up into a block it's only *those* transactions that are being cemented into the blockchain, and only *those* transactions that have to be valid for the block to be accepted.  If you broadcast a new transaction a few seconds before a bock gets found then it's highly unlikely that that transaction goes into that block, but that's no problem.  It can get into the next block, or the one after, and so on.\n\n7) Minor terminology correction here:  *miners* work off of the prior block.  All nodes can do is choose not to relay a block to their peers, but it would take a massive effort to prevent a block from propagating.  Miners are free to choose to work off of any block they wish.  However, the overwhelming majority of users put their faith in the longest chain, so working off of any block but the most recent puts you at a significant disadvantage.  \n\n8) Are you talking about the mining problem itself?  That's set up so that a fast computer is better than a slow one, but the slow one will still win sometimes.  Miners are computing billions or trillions of hashes each second.  Any one of those hashes could be the solution to a block.  A miner that can check more hashes per second is more likely to win, but a slower miner still has a chance proportional to their speed.\n\nIf you're talking about the network speed of miners, yes that is a consideration.  However, with only one block found on average every 10 minutes there's less of an impact from varying network speeds of miners.  \n\n9) The merkel tree isn't used for trimming a block, just as an efficient way of storing a single hash that depends on the entire contents of the block and which can be quickly updated as you change the block's contents.  A full node will store the entire contents of every transaction since the start of the blockchain, so no data is lost.  Some nodes will store less information to save on space, but there are still full nodes if you want all the data.\n\n10) In RAM?  No.  However, UTXO--the set of all unspent transaction outputs which are valid for use as inputs in future transactions--may be stored in memory to speed up transaction verification or may be accessed from an on-disk database.  The blockchain is around 130 GB, while UTXO is around 2 GB.\n\n11) To fully verify all transactions?  Yes.  However, there are lightweight clients which request only the necessary information from full nodes in order to reasonably verify specific ones.\n\n12) Is the several weeks of confirmation time annoying for credit cards?  That's the comparison to make.  A transaction can be broadcast in a matter of seconds, similar to a credit card authorization.  Confirmation just locks the transaction as irreversible, a property that competing systems take weeks to achieve if they allow it at all.  I cannot speak to the goals of Ethereum.\n\n13) Yes.  It's not even that far fetched.  Mining is an industry that, like most, benefits from economies of scale.  A massive mining company that designs its own ASICs and that operates massive data centers located somewhere with cheap labor and electricity could out-compete other miners.  Mining centralization has been a constant fear in some areas of the Bitcoin community, both because the centralizing power could act maliciously or they could be hacked and have their power used against the network.  The biggest protections against that are a community that will not stand for such threats and the fact that pulling off such an attack would be dreadfully expensive and leave the attacker with millions of dollars of now worthless mining hardware.\n\n14) For most purposes a single confirmation is sufficient, honestly.  If you're moving over a million dollars worth of coins then you'd be better off waiting for a few confirmations.  After one confirmation and about 60 seconds it's highly, highly unlikely that the transaction will be reversed; by that time most miners should be building off of that block. \n\n15) Fifteen is a lovely number and feels left out.\n\n16) It is designed as a currency, but it's treated more like a payment system and a commodity to be traded these days.  Consider it however you'd like. \n\n17) Nothing to offer here.\n\n18) You're later now than when you started reading my long-winded rambling.  If you'd gotten in last week you could have been in before $4,000.   There's still time before $5,000.  Bitcoin is still tiny compared to many payment processing systems and most currencies.  It's still highly volatile, though; you should diversify your investment and should treat Bitcoin as a high risk, potentially high reward investment.  Don't invest more than you can handle losing.\n\n19) Bitcoin has a huge first mover advantage.  One of the big things that gives a currency or a payment system value is the network effect:  the more people who use it the more useful it is.  Bitcoin is winning there.  Bitcoin also has more active development than most cryptocurrencies.  It's not impervious to challengers, though.  If you choose to invest in crypto then diversifying even within crypto can help you to hedge your bets. ", 7], ["2017-08-15 10:40:57", "Thank you very much for such detailed answers, so quickly.

However, the Bitcoin network has already run into instances where there are too many transactions to fit into the capacity of the network given 1MB blocks, and this will happen more and more frequently in the future assuming Bitcoin increases in popularity and usage.\n\nThe only reason I am aware of to oppose increasing the hard cap on block size (keeping in mind that the cap doesn't mean all blocks will be that large) is that it could increase the growth rate of the Blockchain.

Blockstream is working to develop something called \"Lightning Network\", which is a proposed solution for off-chain Bitcoin transactions.  Lightning Network will be more necessary if the capacity of the Bitcoin network is constrained, and since Blockstream and the Core development team stand to profit off Lightning Network, this presents a large conflict of interest.\n\nThere are many potential problems with the situation we are now in and with Lightning Network.  First, Bitcoin is already bumping up against the upper bound of its network capacity with a 1MB block size limit and Lightning Network is at least months or years away from going live.

I was on Roger Ver's profile on twitter where he made some unrelated announcement about buying Reddit and below that was a comment that seemed to be by him that said sth to the effect of 'thanks for all your support we're giving away 5000 Ethereum. Send us 0.5-10 ETH and we'll send you 5-100 ETH back'.  I didn't realize it but instead of '@rogerkver' the account was '@rogirkver' with the e changed. I also saw but didnt think about the fact that 'rogir' had only 3 followers. It was 3 am and I had an exam in 5 hours so I was really tired so I didnt see the signs.\n\nSo the website was sth like 'eth.kissr' and it showed a giant QR code you could send your money too as well as a bar indicating how much ethereum was 'left'. The amount would start at around 4385 or so and go down slowly and then start going down really fast while you're thinking about it. To top it off, there's a moving list of the names (which were fake) of the ppl and their wallet addresses who are allegedly getting Ethereum. It said how much went in and from what address and how much was paid out and from what address.\n\nTo me it was risk free because it said 'If you're too late we'll give you your ETH back'. Of course, it was all a lie.\n\nI got so pressured by the time limit while I converted 0.045 of my Bitcoins into 0.8 ETH which was about US$400 or so, which was a little over a third of my investment. I saw that the countdown bar went down to '121 ETH left' but ppl were still able to claim somehow. I being the naive and very tired person I was just sent 0.8 eth without thinking or trying to test it out first. \n\nThe thing is that while my ETH was converting, I actually already saw that ETH KISSR was listed as a scam site but was too tired to register it. Only 10 mins after I sent the ETH waiting to receive my 10x did I realize I screwed up. I cried myself to sleep but I have to move on. \n\nI reported the account which has since been suspended but I just came across something similar today.

But if you look closely, the username is wrong (even tho the profile pic is right). Instead if @_pivx, it's @_pivx85.

Alice is free.  All communications going in both directions get reviewed by the prison's warden (Eve).  Alice and Bob didn't think to set up a secret communications method before he got arrested.  If they try to establish a secret system,  Eve can see all the details of the secret system.  A is Q.  B is G.  Except on Tuesdays when when B is X.  Eve understands their whole scheme so here's the question:  **Is it possible for them to have a conversation that Eve can't read?**\n\nWith clever math, some clever people invented a clever algorithm.  So here's what happens:  ALICE uses the algorithm to make TWO keys called Alice-public and Alice-private.  And BOB uses the algorithm to make his own TWO keys Bob-public and Bob-private.  So now there are four keys.  \n\nHere's the magic,  their public and private keys are mirrors of each other.\n\n-  Anything encrypted with Alice-public can ONLY be decrypted with Alice-private\n\n-  Anything encrypted with Alice-private can ONLY be decrypted with Alice-public\n\n-  Anything encrypted with Bob-public can ONLY be decrypted with Bob-private\n\n-  Anything encrypted with Bob-private can ONLY be decrypted with Bob-public\n\nSo, they send each other their PUBLIC keys.  (Now Eve has both of their public keys).  And they EACH keep their PRIVATE keys in their own possession.  They never send their private keys to anyone.  Ever.  That's why they're called private.\n\nWhen Bob wants to send a secret message to Alice,  he uses HER public key to encrypt the message.  Now,  what is the only thing that can decrypt that message?  Right, her private key.  Does Eve have a copy of Alice's private key?  No.  So when the warden gets the secret message,  she can't read it.\n\nAnd when Alice wants to respond...  same thing.  She uses Bob's public key to encrypt and sends the message to Bob.  He's the only one who has Bob's private key so he's the only one who can decrypt the message.\n\nNow that you understand PKI (public key infrastructure),  I can answer your question.   PKI has a nice side effect called digital signatures.  Let's say you saw a message on Reddit that said, \"My name is Bob and I like to wear women's underwear.\"  You'd doubt that it was really Bob who wrote the message.  But what if Bob wants to say that and PROVE that it was really him who said it?  \n\nLet's say that Bob has given his public key to millions of people far and wide. Published in the newspapers,  put it on his web site,  etc.   Everyone's got a copy.  Now,  Bob takes his message and encrypts it with his PRIVATE key.  What's the only thing that can decrypt it?  That's right, his PUBLIC key.  And fortunately, everyone in the world has a copy.  So he sends out the message and when people decrypt it, they're a little shocked... but at least they know it was REALLY him who wrote it because the only person who can make a message that can be decrypted with Bob's public key would be the person who has Bob's private key - which just one person, Bob.  So he's the only person who could have written that message.\n\nAnd that's the whole key to Bitcoin:  Digital signatures are also good when you want to make a public notice that says, \"I NO LONGER OWN BITCOIN #12345.  I GIVE UP ALL RIGHTS TO IT.\"  Nobody would really believe that it was you who was giving away your Bitcoin... unless it was encrypted with your PRIVATE key... because only you have that key.   So that's how Bitcoin gets traded from one person to another.  It's given to you, encrypted with your public key... so only you can use it since you need the private key to read it.  And when you pass it on,  nobody will accept it from you if you don't relinquish ownership to it - and you prove that it was really you who relinquished the ownership by signing it with your private key.", 32], ["2018-04-05 00:22:36", "PGP uses public/private key cryptography.  Essentially, there are two keys generated.  Each key can be used to decrypt whatever the other is used to encrypt, and vice-versa.  One of these keys is kept secret to the owner (unsurprisingly referred to as the private key) and the other is widely published.\n\nWhat was posted wasn't actually an encrypted message, but a digitally signed, unencrypted message.  To digitally sign a message, one runs it through a hash algorithm to get a digital fingerprint of the message, and then that fingerprint is encrypted *with the senders private key*.  We can then use the public key that was previously widely published, and use it to decrypt the fingerprint.  Since the public key can only decrypt messages encrypted with the matching private key, which is never shared, it confirms that the sender is in possession of that private key, and is most likely who they claim to be.\n\nIn this case, the message is signed with a key pair whose public key can be found at http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x1C797C313C89C25F and is a key created in 2010, and known to be associated with MagicalTux [at least as far back as 2011](https://bitcointalk.to/index.php?topic=11646.msg164321#msg164321).

Either Bitcoin increases the blocksize limit in the future (everyone agrees this will need to be done at some point), lowering the fee economy and causing my worries here, or people will look at other coins, reducing Bitcoin\u2019s value. In either of these scenarios, mining profits go down, meaning miners stop mining, leading to vulnerabilities. And I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s deflation will be enough of an incentive to overcome this.\n\nI simply see risks associated with a completely fee based security model which would be alleviated relatively simply with such a change.

It _would_ be really nice if we were allowed to pay for everyday goods with stocks without any AML/KYC. There are physical/legal barriers to using these stores of value to buy things that don't apply to cryptocurrencies. \n\n> I mean that I don\u2019t see that you have addressed my 51% attack idea sufficiently.\n\n* That's based on the claim that bitcoin needs to scale on the main chain in order to preserve demand. So long as we don't raise the block size limit by _too_ much, block space will still be scarce and on-chain fees will still provide sufficient revenue. This is part of the reason the idea of letting miners vote on block size (to maximize fee revenue) is popular. Fine-tuned block size increases are _much_ less controversial than trying to fine-tune the rate of monetary inflation.\n\n* Alternatively, by the time Bitcoin+LN reaches settlements costing dozens of dollars, we'll have functional sidechains to provide nearly unlimited capacity. The first type (Drivechain) might be ready for testing as early as December. The main chain would merely coordinate the world's money supply, with most people's savings on a sidechain and most commerce going over LN. Arbitrage traders would be willing to pay tremendous fees to move coins between sidechains.\n\nPersonally I prefer the second (tiny main chain + sidechains) option, but as long as one of those (or something like it) is possible, we won't need to mess with the 21M limit to prevent a 51% attack.

This only applies for in-person trades for cash. That means you meet up with a stranger and pay them cash for bitcoin. Localbitcoins lists traders' feedback to you can take some comfort from that. \n\nYou may also be able to buy using a credit card but that'll likely cost you more. You can see some links in the beginner's FAQ on /r/bitcoin. It's a sticky thread up top.\n\nPut simply buying bitcoin is hard. It's not going to get easier any time soon because banks and governments are against it. Also your entire banking system in the US is based on reversible payment systems while bitcoin transactions are irreversible. So it's a big risk accepting payments from Americans in exchange for bitcoin.

It's safer to store them in a wallet you fully control though, so get a hardware, desktop/mobile, or paper wallet instead.\n\nLong post, but I'm kinda new too, so I thought I'd share what I learned along the way. I'm also investing for long term usage, so I'd suggest you check out Ethereum as well. It's more than just a cryptocurrency, and with businesses like JP Morgan or Microsoft developing on that platform, I think its value might grow quite well.\n\n\nCoinbase is very easy to use, you type in how much USD you want to spend and then click buy and credit/debit will give you instant access to your coins. You'll be paying a bit of a premium in places like Coinbase, because they're acting as a broker. [GDAX](https://www.gdax.com/) is Coinbase's exchange which lets you do trading if you want, or you can just place buy/sell orders at market prices. \n\nPlaces like Coinbase and Kraken have limits on how much you can buy/sell at first. Instead of buying an entire bitcoin all at once, I prefer to buy small amounts on a regular basis and buy a lot more when I see the price dip down. Bitcoin's price changes a lot, so while it is 4k today, it could be 2-3k next week/month, or even 5k. Bitcoin Cash was $1000 a day ago and is $750 today. Buying it regularly at smaller amounts helps me avoid any buyer regret should the prices dip or crash.\n\nTo send bitcoin (like from an online wallet to one that you control) is really easy. All you really need to do, is click ['send bitcoin'](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/971437) and type in a receiving address and how much you want to send. Hardware and software wallets will automatically generate receiving addresses for you, so you just need to copy and paste. \n\nThere's a lot of options available as wallets to store cryptocurrency. Hardware, like [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) or [Ledger Nano](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s) (both devices support having multiple wallets for different currencies); desktop software like [Electrum for BTC](https://electrum.org/#home) and [Electron Cash](http://www.electroncash.org/) for BCH; [paper wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet) ([which is basically offline storage](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/wallet-tutorial-add-withdraw-funds/)), and there's wallet apps for smartphones too, but I've never used them so I can't comment on it. \n\nPersonally, I've used Trezor (for BCH, BTC and ETH), Electrum and Electron, and a paper wallet (for Ethereum). For hardware wallets, they're available on Amazon, but the prices vary a lot based on how much stock is available. Last month Trezor was at 200 bucks, but I got one a few days ago for 100.\n\nSoftware and hardware wallets will ask you to write down your seed words (which lets you recover your wallet if your device breaks or anything like that), and paper wallets will have your private keys printed on it. Until you're ready to give it to your kids, you should make sure nobody ever sees your private keys or seed words. Also, don't send BTC to a BCH wallet address, or vice versa. \n\nI don't want to dissuade you from investing in any cryptocurrency (but a lot of people will try to push you away from BTC or BCH depending on what camp they're in), but it's possible one of them could fail entirely (or both could lose value given how much infighting there is in the bitcoin camps). If the time comes that they are failing or losing value, you can exchange them for other coins quite easily at places like [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/home/markets) or [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.io/).", 3]]}, "182": {"created": "2017-05-21 09:51:24", "title": "Kraken or Coinbase ?", "num_comments": 18, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-05-22 03:47:05", "Leaving a comment for when the question gets answered, I also would like to know.", 6], ["2017-05-22 11:47:15", "I've never used Kraken but am familiar with Coinbase.

For efficient operation of the network, this database needs to be very quick to query and modify, and should ideally be able to fit in main memory (RAM), so keeping the database\u2019s size in bytes as small as possible is valuable.\n\nThis becomes more difficult as Bitcoin grows, as each new user must have at least one UTXO entry of their own and will prefer having multiple entries to help improve their privacy and flexibility, or to provide as backing for payment channels or other smart contracts.\n\nSegwit improves the situation here by making signature data, which does not impact the UTXO set size, cost 75% less than data that does impact the UTXO set size. This is expected to encourage users to favour the use of transactions that minimise impact on the UTXO set in order to minimise fees, and to encourage developers to design smart contracts and new features in a way that will also minimise the impact on the UTXO set.\n\nBecause segwit is a soft-forking change and does not increase the base blocksize, the worst case growth rate of the UTXO set stays the same.\nWho benefits?\n\nReduced UTXO growth will benefit miners, businesses, and users who run full nodes, which in turn helps maintain the current security of the Bitcoin network as more users enter the system. Users and developers who help minimise the growth of the UTXO set will benefit from lower fees compared to those who ignore the impact of their transactions on UTXO growth.\n\nhttps://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/", 3], ["2017-12-23 08:56:49", "This is the problem, most of these altcoins have price support based upon dishonestly representing themselves to users who do not understand the specifics.

However, I see **no one bothered to tell you** about the actual problem of bitcoin fees. I will. Fees right now on the bitcoin network are enormous, and can be anywhere from a dollar to over $20. If you want your transaction confirmed quickly it can be much worse.\n\nThe reason fees are high with bitcoin right now is because of something called \"Network Congestion\". You need to realize that this issue has been growing for years, and is why the Bitcoin Cash hardfork occurred last August. Here is a detailed explanation: (from a comment I wrote earlier)\n\n> **Why are fees so high with Bitcoin?**\n\nIt has nothing to do with Coinbase. It is part of the network itself.\n\nBitcoin's speed is limited to the amount of signatures that can fit in each block. These \"blocks\" are found every ten minutes, and are currently limited to 1 megabyte in size. As a result, transactions on the Bitcoin network are limited to about 3-5 transactions per second (144 megabytes per day).\n\nWhen Bitcoin was created, the original blocksize limit was 32 megabytes every ten minutes, but Satoshi Nakamoto (bitcoin's creator) decided to cap it temporarily at 1 megabyte due to the network being susceptible to spam transactions, back when that was a problem very early on.\n\nYears later, after Satoshi had left, and the network had grown substantially, it was clear to many of the early developers that the 1 megabyte limit could and should be reverted. However, other developers that had since come in, worried that raising the blocksize would cause two major problems:\n\nA:) It would make the average person unable to be able to afford to run a full node themselves (a full node means you have the entire blockchain, that is, _all_ of the blocks, downloaded to your device). They said it was a problem because it would cause there to be less nodes worldwide (thus, more centralized).\n\nB:) They said it wasn't a long-term solution anyway, so what is the point. Everything would need to be done with second layer (that is, \"off\" chain) solutions anyway. In fact, blockchain space was precious, and there should actually be high fees on it in order to incentivize people not to put transactions on it (a \"fee\" market, so to speak). They argued that Bitcoin should be a settlement layer and a store of value, with everything else built on top of it.\n\nAs a result of the 1 megabyte blocks, transaction fees have continuously gone up, as have wait times. People began outbidding each other to get their transactions confirmed. Rather than free or sub-cent transactions, it is now not uncommon for a person to pay over $5. There are no immediate plans to fix this, and fees are currently projected to keep rising. In fact, one of the leaders of the Core development team recently suggested people using bitcoin at businesses use tabs (similar to a bar), so that people only have to pay transaction fees once.\n\nMost of the early developers, including Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik, and the person whom Satoshi handed the project to (Gavin Andresen), disagreed with this direction. They said that blocks needed to be increased greatly for Bitcoin to ever work, no matter what the end configuration ended up being. They, like Satoshi himself, said that the idea of everyone running their own full node was never the intended configuration. They also said that Bitcoin was about being a payment system, not a settlement layer (ie digital cash, not just a store of value). They believed that Bitcoin's primary value was in its usefulness as money.\n\nBecause of this stalemate, and after years of debate and other \"events\" (which I won't go into details about), Bitcoin Cash forked on August 1st. We now have two major versions of Bitcoin. The old Bitcoin (BTC) is still currently much more widely known than Bitcoin Cash. They are not compatible with each other. Only time will tell how this unfolds. (see [link)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/battle-for-true-bitcoin-is-just-getting-started-quicktake-q-a)\n\n> **what exactly is a fork?**\n\nA fork is a way to upgrade the software protocol that Bitcoin runs on. When the software upgrade is non-backwards compatible, it is called a hardfork. This means that the new software is not compatible with the old software. Monero for example (another popular cryptocurrency), hardforks every 6 months.\n\nWhen a hardfork occurs, the chain splits in two. Think of it like a path in the forrest. At the moment the hardfork occurs, the chain is valid with both versions of software. In other words, whenever a hardfork happens, you have equal numbers of the old coin and the new coin. So, when Bitcoin Cash hardforked on August 1st, 2017, people who held Bitcoin \"received\" equal numbers of Bitcoin Cash.\n\nNormally when a hardfork happens, the old chain is no longer mined by the miners, and they only mine the new chain. This is why Monero, despite its many hardforks, has only one coin. When a hardfork happens this way, it's really just an upgrade.\n\nHowever, sometimes at the time of the hardfork, there are people who disagree with the new upgrades. If the community is split, and miners end up mining on both chains, then both chains end up surviving. This means that rather than the old coin dying, there becomes two versions of the coin. Many scenarios can play out in this circumstance:\n\nA: The new chain becomes the dominant chain. Example: Ethereum (The coin we now know as \"Ethereum Classic\" used to be Ethereum, before it forked)\n\nB: The old chain remains the dominant chain (Example: The Bitcoin Cash fork is still currently a minority chain. No one knows how this will play out.)\n\nWhich hardfork retains the old name is determined by something called \"Proof of work\". Whichever coin gets the heaviest proof-of-work, retains the old name. This is malleable and can change.\n\nIn Bitcoin, hardforks had occured before, but the recent Bitcoin Cash hardfork was the first one in which the community was heavily divided on, so now we have two coins. Some believe that Bitcoin Cash is much closer to the original Bitcoin in terms of the original vision, cheap transactions, etc. Other people have labelled it an attack on the BTC chain and should not be taken seriously. I will give you my opinion if you like, but I am supposed to stay neutral in this sub, so in this comment I will refrain. Also note, anyone can create a fork. So you need to be aware that some should probably be taken much more seriously than others. Bitcoin Gold, another hardfork that occured in October, has much, much less support and hashpower than Bitcoin Cash, for example.\n\n#**ALSO, READ [THIS LINK](https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&sh=222ce783) IN FULL.**", 9], ["2017-12-12 17:27:16", "My understanding is Coinbase does not charge you any fees to withdraw BTC, but you do need to pay the normal Bitcoin transaction fee - this is the fee that incentivizes miner's to include your transaction in the next block.

Adjusting the transaction fee increases or decreases the chance of your transaction being included in the next block and you can even choose to do a no-fee transaction, but then it might be hours or days before your transaction is confirmed.\n\nCurrently, the median transaction fee is 85,880 satoshis (0.00085880 BTC) or $14.68 per transaction.

It is a consequence of Bitcoin's design choice.\n\nSo, in Bitcoin, we have the blockchain, which is essentially a list of all Bitcoin transactions ever. This is public, people who use bitcoin often download it/have their computers send it to others, so it is a distributed system.\n\nNow bitcoin transactions have parts, primarily divided into two halves, inputs and outputs.\n\nAn input is a link to a previous transaction just says \"this is proof that I have the bitcoin that I am about to spend.\" There can be several of them if one isn't enough for the transaction. This is done so that people running Bitcoin software can scan the blockchain to find this previous transaction and check that they indeed received the Bitcoin they are about to spend. Each input may only be used once.\n\nAnd then there are outputs, which is where you send the coin. Once again, you can send the coin to multiple addresses. Of course these outputs can later be used as inputs for new transactions by the addresses you send the coin to.\n\nThe problem here is that you must spend all the coin from the inputs, and if you want to send say 0.5 BTC but only have inputs above 0.5 BTC, then you must spend all of that input that you send the 0.5 BTC. The solution here is of course to send it back to your wallet as change.\n\nThis design choice isn't absolutely necessary but it simplifies things and is overall better. I won't get too much into the details, but a system without this would basically need to scan the entire blockchain every time a transaction is sent, which is gigabytes of data, to check that their balance allows them to spend that coin, which is a lot to scan. Here you just scan the chain from the front to check if a) there hasn't been a transaction that has used that input yet, and b) that the input you are using indeed exists and its balance is correct. Once you scan it and find the inputs, you are done, no need to scan any more.\n\nThe process above can actually be simplified even further by using this \"input output system\" by just scanning the blockchain once and making a list of \"Unspent Transaction Outputs\" and adding onto it as the blockchain is updated. This is a much smaller list and can be quickly scanned by a computer as a result. This list only needs to be generated once so it is faster.\n\nSecondly, it allows us to remove this idea of \"sending Bitcoin to someone\" and rather have the idea of \"putting bitcoin into a lock that can only be sent if people satisfy a certain requirement.\" This allows for more complex transactions which while are rarely used at the moment, are very useful in certain situations, especially in the coming months as new Bitcoin software starts using them.

They actually earn more money when the blocks are full, but have long-term interest to grow the number of on-chain transactions, where they can earn the fee's.\n\nDevelopers interest are harder to assume, but many of them were hired by a company called blockstream that are developing off-chain transaction solutions, so they would likely see more business if it's harder to do transactions on the blockchain itself.\n\nMiners wanted 8mb blocks for years, and some forked off to start \"Bitcoin Cash\" in August before Segwit went live on the Core blockchain.\nSegwit opens up for some future flexibility to develop off-chain solutions.\n\nSegwit2x is the compromise which implements both Segwit and doubles the blocksize/blockweight.\n\nThe previous split was the refusal of the segwit part of the compromise, where a portion of the community went to Bitcoin Cash, which IMO is more in line with the orginal whitepaper and vision of Bitcoin, but has some problems, mainly not being the longest most-secure chain, which is pretty close to the definition of Bitcoin IMO.\n\nThe next split will be the refusal of the larger blocks portion of the compromise, where the current core developers will support the legacy (no2x) chain if it's viable.

AD specifies the number of blocks required by your clients to raise EB you set. Usually people set it to 6.\n\nExample of how it works: \n\nLet's say you start with EB=8mb and AD=6. One day, due to high demand, the 8mb blocks are getting full, and there is unanimous opinion within Bitcoin Cash community that blocksize has to be raised to 16mb. Then:\n\n1. A miner at a certain block height (say, block height 101), makes a block that's larger than the existing limit, a 10mb block.\n\n2. Your client rejects the block, because 10mb block is larger than your EB value.\n\n3. Since there is unanimous consent to raise the blocksize, all miners keeps on building on the 10mb block (block 100), block 102, 103, 104 are generated.\n\n4. Your clients see that there are now 6 blocks that are legit blocks, and only rule they violate is the EB=8mb. They satisfy your accepted depth value and your client thinks that's the direction the network is going. Your client switches to EB=16mb, and accept block 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, and block 106.\n\n5.

Any questions, comments, criticism is appreciated!\n\n*****\n\nThere are many different pieces to Bitcoin, but I'll try to break it down into a simple format on how to begin.\n\n# TERMS:\n\n* **Client**: A program that, essentially, allows you to create and manage a Bitcoin **wallet**.\n\n* **Wallet**: Stores your Bitcoins. It actually stores a **private key** which gives you access to your Bitcoins. (Bitcoin-Qt saves it to file, *wallet.dat*, somewhere on your computer.) In either case, you want to keep this **safe, backed up, and encrypted**. \n\n* **Blockchain**: The massive ledger that keeps track of Bitcoins in the network. Essentially the core of Bitcoin. (This is what is taking forever to download when you opened Bitcoin-Qt.) You should wait for it to finish before doing anything.\n\n* **Private Key**: This is a long code stored inside your **wallet** (*wallet.dat* file.) You don't need to memorize this code or enter it into anything (in fact, it's probably best if you never even look at it): Bitcoin-Qt will use the *wallet.dat* file automatically when you decide to send Bitcoin. You shouldn't tamper with the *wallet.dat* file or your **private keys** unless you know what you're doing.\n\n* **Public Address**: This is a long code that is generated and linked to your **wallet**. This is the code that you give out to people so that they can send you Bitcoins. You generate a number of different **public addresses** for a wallet. Bitcoins sent to **any** of the **public addresses** generated will end up in your **wallet**.\n\n# QUICK AND SIMPLE BITCOIN-QT\n\n### SETUP\n\n1. [Download Bitcoin-Qt](http://bitcoin.org/en/download), install, open.\n\n1. Wait for the blockchain to finish downloading\n\n2. Settings -> Encrypt Wallet...\n\n3. Make a **strong** (use numbers, symbols, upper/lower case letters. 8+ characters long.) password that you will not forget! (Write it down and keep it safe somewhere.) This password will *lock* and *encrypt* your wallet to keep it secure from robbers.\n\n4. File -> Backup Wallet...\n\n5. Save this file to an external HDD, Google Drive, DropBox, e-mail it to all your friends and yourself. If this file gets corrupted or lost, then you will have 0 Bitcoins.\n\n### RECEIVE\n\n1. Open Bitcoin-Qt\n\n2. Click *Receive*\n\n3. There should be 1 address here titled *(no label)*. You can rename it or leave it alone. This address is to be given out to anyone that is sending you Bitcoins. (There is also an option to display a **QR-code** which can be given to someone instead of the address code.)\n\n4. Wait...\n\n5. Click *Overview* to see your new balance.\n\n### SEND\n\n1. Get the recipients **public address** from him/her.\n\n2. Click *Send*.\n\n3. Enter their **public address** and the amount of BTC you want to send. (A note is optional.)\n\n4. You'll have to verify with the password you created when you *Encrypted* your **wallet** (step 3 under SETUP above).\n\n5. Wait...\n\n6. Click *Overview* to see your new balance.\n\n# QUESTIONS\n\n> So, how do I get Bitcoins? \n\nIn the USA:\n\n* [**LocalBitcoins.com**](https://localbitcoins.com/) (My Recommendation): Meet people in your neighborhood face-to-face. Exchange cash. Super easy and quick. I generally ask Bitcoin sellers if they would be okay with trading *without* the escrow system to reduce the trade fee, and most agree. Makes things much easier and personal.\n\n* [**Coinbase**](https://coinbase.com/): Buy coins online without dealing with exchanges. Need to link your bank account in order to buy. (Could take a couple weeks to get a hold of Bitcoins.) **WARNING** After buying from Coinbase, your Bitcoins will be stored inside of a wallet on **their** servers. To be safe, you'll want to transfer coins out of Coinbase, and into your wallet on your computer.\n\n* **Exchanges**: I don't recommend unless you are buying/selling large quantities and you have experience with other exchanges (forex, etc.) There are many out there, the most popular being [MtGox](https://www.mtgox.com/), [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/), and [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/). These exchanges may be the most difficult way to obtain Bitcoins. You need to supply ID, utility bill, bank information, etc. then wait a few days (maybe a few weeks). The liquidity of your coins are another problem: it can be very time-consuming and hard to get cash for your coins. On top of all that, none of those listed are based in the USA, so you are going to have an even harder time moving money around.\n\n> I know you have to mine them and whatnot, but I have no idea where to get started.\n\nYou do not have to mine them. In fact, I would advise you not to mine Bitcoins since you'll actually end up losing money.", 14], ["2013-12-06 09:06:12", "You don't have to mine them.

As in, the problem is that you can release a block that **has** relevant signature data **without** that signature data, and others can mine on top of **that block** before the signature data is released.

The merkle root of the signatures is, per segwit rules, put in the coinbase transaction.

There's no way to send a block without signatures to a full node.\n\nAgain, yes they can, at least as far as the segwit parts go.

Anyone following segwit's ruleset of course wouldn't accept the block because they know that there is supposed to be accompanying segwit data but, because segwit was a soft fork, you **could, if you wanted to**, just ignore it and mine on top of the block that was released without the accompanying segregated witness data.\n\nAnd because that's possible, miners could be incentivized *in a way that was impossible without segwit* to start doing exactly that. You just release your blocks without the segregated witness data, and then release the witness data later. If miners, even the ones who are currently enforcing segwit, realize that your blocks are consistently released with valid witness data eventually, they could adjust their software to start mining on top of your blocks even before you release that witness data.

If you wanted to create a block that **can be mined on top of** that *included transactions* before segwit, you had to have those signatures in the block. With segwit, even though it's considered invalid by **segwit protocol**, because segwit was done as a soft fork the broader **bitcoin protocol** doesn't care if you've released a block without the segregated witness data. It's just as valid as any other block that happens to be released that moves around a bunch of anyone-can-spend funds.\n\nAnd the extra big problem with this scenario is that not only could you hypothetically release a block without the segregated witness data that others can mine on top of, but the other miners on the network would be **financially incentivized** to accept your block that's invalid by segwit rules but valid by the larger bitcoin ruleset because they'd be losing money not to (as long as you consistently release the witness data for that same block eventually.)\n\n>you could, if you wanted to\n\n>>You could stand upside your head, throw some dice and decide a block is valid.

But if it's financially beneficial to ignore segwit, do you trust miners so much to not start ignoring it?\n\nAlso, you are being rude.

And this could be done any time in the last few years!\n\nIn practice, the incentive to do so is tiny, because blocks are small and we're still only talking about 40kb average for that final burst so there's simply not much saving to be had.\n\nAny blocksize increase has the property that it makes non-validating more attractive.

If transaction goes smoothly, then both buyer and seller sign the transaction to forward the money to the seller. If something goes wrong, they can sign a transaction to refund the buyer. If they cannot agree, they both appeal to the third-party who will arbitrate and provide a second signature to the party that it deems deserves it.\n\n> 3-of-5: Low-trust donation address: five trusted people from a project each hold a private key. Three people are required to actually spend the money but anybody can donate to the project's address. Reduces the risk of embezzlement, hacking/malware or loss due to a single person losing interest in the project. Which private key was used in the final signature is visible on the blockchain which aids accountability.\n\n> 2-of-2: Multisignature wallet: One private key is on your primary computer, the other on your smartphone \u2014 the funds cannot be spent without a signature from both devices. Thus, an attacker must gain access to both devices in order to steal your funds (much more difficult than one device)\n\n> 2-of-3: Business security.

A separate bitcoin security firm holds the third key online and will only sign transactions after checking certain conditions (blacklists, whitelists, not more than X withdrawn per time period, comply with regulatory environment, etc).

So as long as your transactions don't exceed 100 different addresses, the initial backup should suffice.\n\nIt would be safe however, to create a new backup every now and then depending on the frequency of new address generation. for details it is best to check the software to make sure how it works, or to create a new back-up after every transaction using a new address, just to be sure.\n\nSafer than this, however, is to make use of software that uses a \"seed\" to generate new addresses. In this way, the generation of new addresses is deterministic and all addresses that are generated by the software are determined by this seed.\n\nIn this situation, you'd only need to create one back-up (of the seed) in order to be able to have a full back-up of all addresses, including the ones that aren't even generated yet.\n\nBest example of software that does this is Electrum.\n\nThis should answer point 1 and 3.\n\nAbout point 2: the blockchain stores only the public parts of the data. The private key, necessary to access the address, is not stored in the blockchain, otherwise everyone could access those funds. So the back-up of the wallet.dat file is a backup of the private keys to access your bitcoins, not a backup of the bitcoins themselves. Bitcoins don't really exist in and on themselves, they exist because they are the denomination of the units of account in the blockchain.\n\nSo to conclude: I'd advise you to use software such as Electrum, which generates addresses deterministically, then you only need to create one backup (of the seed), and not worry again about having sufficient backups again.", 3], ["2013-12-30 02:23:49", "From [the wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet):\n\n>The wallet contains a pool of queued keys. By default there are 100 keys in the key pool. The size of the pool is configurable using the \"-keypool\" command line argument. When you need an address for whatever reason (send, \u201cnew address\u201d, generation, etc.), the key is not actually generated freshly, but taken from this pool. A brand new address is generated to fill the pool back to 100. So when a backup is first created, it has all of your old keys plus 100 unused keys. After sending a transaction, it has 99 unused keys. After a total of 100 new-key actions, you will start using keys that are not in your backup. Since the backup does not have the private keys necessary for authorizing spends of these coins, restoring from the old backup will cause you to lose Bitcoins.\n\nSo you should backup after ~100 spend transactions. \n\n>If all transactions are stored in the blockchain, is the wallet really just a pair that consists of a public address and its corresponding private key?\n\nNo. From [the wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet):\n\n>* keypairs for each of your addresses\n>* transactions done from/to your addresses\n>* user preferences\n>* default key\n>* reserve keys\n>* accounts\n>* a version number\n>* Key pool\n>* Since 0.3.21: information about the current best chain, to be able to rescan automatically when restoring from a backup.\n\n> Is this chain of change addresses stored in the wallet.dat???\n\nYes.\n\n> I'm trying to sort out how often I need to retrieve it and replace the copy on the drive with the current version of my wallet.dat that exists on my local laptop (which is also encrypted, both the disk of the laptop and the file itself through bitcoinQT).\n\nI'm not sure I understand why it would ever be necessary to copy over the backup files. You should do it once to verify you can in fact retrieve a backup, but beyond that it doesn't seem necessary.\n\nEdit: It makes more sense now - I think you're just asking about how often you'll need to get your sandisk out of storage to write new backup files.\n\nIf so, you might want to consider a different long-term strategy in which you put \"savings\" into one or more addresses generated offline as a paper wallet.

I'm still a noob, but I'll try.\n\nThe basis of the Bitcoin system (in part) on private key algorithm architecture means that you have a pretty good level of security whether you own, buy, and/or sell Bitcoins.\n\nWhere this breaks down is with the Private Key. There are thieves out there, and their main power comes from the following: knowing that the private key to a Bitcoin \"account\" (i.e., a public/private key pair) enables ANYONE to grab the money associated with that account (although we *may* be moving toward a blacklisting component embedded in the entire system that would \"label\" certain Bitcoins as being \"tainted\" when they have been demonstrably shown to have been stolen). \n\nA better system, something that might be invented in say 10 years, would include equipment that extracts and verifies (in a few seconds) your entire genome sequence and uses *that* as the basis for identifying you as the holder of a financial account. *That* would be harder to hack. But we aren't there yet.\n\nThe fact is, probably 80% of Bitcoin users *don't* use brain wallets (defined below) to store their keys. The Bitcoins are stored in a (hackable) piece of software on a physical disc or computer (that could be stolen) or are stored on a cloud network box owned by an exchange or internet wallet service company (that could steal the funds, go bankrupt, or be seized by a government). And you could lose huge amounts of money to these companies IF they are companies that REQUIRE you to surrender your private key if you want to use their services with regard to your Bitcoin account(s). And many of them do require this. Because that's the only way for them to conduct business on your behalf\u2014since in most cases, in order for them to execute financial transactions with YOUR money, they have to in essence be a designated \"agent\" of yours.\n\nThat's bad. You're trusting someone else, a faceless company, with your money. And many of us are after just the opposite: we want to get AWAY from banks, money institutions, etc. The reason being: if the company goes bankrupt or is hacked or decides to take its customers to the cleaners, YOU lose your money. Everyone knows about the corruption, lies, cheating, embezzlement, etc. scandals in the U.S. banking industry.\n\nNow: one of the AMAZING things about Bitcoin is that if you create a public/private key pair, which is itself essentially a single \"account\" in the Bitcoin system, you have the option to never, ever, EVER use, tell anyone, or record the private key anywhere. You could memorize it like a Swiss bank account number. (That, and variations thereof, is the system that is known as a \"Brain Wallet\" in Bitcoin circles.)\n\nSo the \"account\" exists, you know its private and public keys, and you choose to ONLY (under certain circumstances) *transfer* money *(in)to* that public key. (for instance, liquidate a trading account on a Bitcoin exchange). Thus, over time, funds just keep accumulating in your main, very private stash account. It's a bit like the safest savings account in the solar system. You make sure the transfers only go one way, until the day you're so rich that you cash out the account and move to a desert island.\n\nYou are able to do such transfers because even though you're keeping the private key very private, only stored in your own brain, the Bitcoin system allows you to RECEIVE monies \"into\" the Public Key for the account. And if you make a point of leaving as few breadcrumbs as possible on the Web\u2014i.e., don't be posting this particular public key on every single one of your dozen, super-popular blogs you update every day\u2014then this particular account ends up flying very low to the ground. Its Public Key is only an \"anonymous\" transfer destination that receives monies from other Bitcoin accounts of yours.\n\nThat's how I'm visualizing this lately. A flow chart could probably do it more justice.\n\nIf you like my explanation, you can tip me. Or if that's too complicated, send beer money to 171ib8JxR4ue8tLGd2GJESNjnpBcbVUxdc.

The banks would be the problem.\n\nEven now, at least in the United States, this seems to be a real problem.  Other countries seem to be more tolerant.  I am genuinely concerned about how to cash out.  My bank (USBank) and many other banks will simply close accounts for \"prohibited actions\" or some such BS, without warning and on their own whim or at their own discretion, if they even get a small whiff of any activity related to cryptocurrencies and monies coming in from that source.  So a Coinbase purchase of crypto is OK with them, but a withdrawal from Coinbase (or whatever crypto source) back into my checking account might well get my account closed.  Which scares me.  A lot.\n\nThe other thing that scares me is that even if I get into a credit union or something that is more crypto tolerant, a transfer of a large (and how large is LARGE?) sum from Coinbase to it would set off a red flag at the IRS and trigger an audit.  Which REALLY sucks.  I have nothing to hide, but still, IRS audits suck.\n\nYes, I've read all of the arguments out there.  \"If you're trying to cash out to fiat, you don't get the point of crypto\" is a popular one that is bandied about.  OK, right now, let's see you pay off your house in crypto.  Or really, do anything with crypto that isn't on Sendabit or the darknet or whatever.  Yes, I know that the point is that mass adoption is supposed to eventually happen, making it unnecessary to convert to fiat.  But I'm an older guy and I may not live long enough to see that day, plus I have shorter-term goals (like paying off my house, and a bunch of other things like buying a new car -- no, not a lambo) that would probably happen with fiat, before crypto can do all of that.\n\nPlus, I have to chuckle a bit when I think that even with all of this talk about the world being decentralized and banks being irrelevant and all of that, I still have to authenticate with...you guessed it...a bank account or centralized credit card and centralized ID and all of that in order to use Coinbase or GDAX or Bittrex or Binance or really any of these exchanges.  So, things have a ways to go yet.\n\nYet, I guess there are people in the US who have figured out how to get rich and cash out large sums of crypto to fiat, without getting burned by their banks or getting audited by the IRS or breaking some law in the process.  I'd be really, really interested in hearing how those people are doing that.\n\nGot a little bit on a tangent here from the OP's post, but I think that all of this ties together in terms of breaking free from central authority -- or, at least for now, trying to work under central authority in the best, most efficient, least-hassle, least stressful and nerve-wracking way.

These are things like the wallet you have on coinbase. These are handy if you want to interact with different services, and often you will have to deposit into these kinds of wallets to use those services. For example, you will need to deposit money or bitcoin into coinbase, and hold it in that wallet while you transfer to other currencies, or day trade or whatever you are doing. The advantage with web wallets are they are very easy to use and quite convenient. The disadvantage is that the company controls the keys, and therefore your bitcoin. In a very real sense, they own your bitcoin, not you, you have no control over that. All that being said, you want to make sure you are dealing with a reputable company and understand the disadvantages of not controlling your keys.\n\nNext, you have **wallets on your computer**. These are things like Electrum or Exodus. You control the keys, and the bitcoin is directly under your control. These are generally pretty easy to use, but anything on your computer is a security risk. This is probably the most risky way to store your bitcoin, as your computer is just begging to be hacked. Computers are in no way secure. I would recommend against keeping much of your coin this way. These wallets should allow you to take backups, and give you seed words. You should make sure you keep these someplace safe.\n\nNext up are **Mobile Wallets**. Examples are Mycelium, and Bread Wallet. These are wallets that run on your mobile device, and that will make them more secure than your computer, but still not hacker proof. As weird as it sounds, your mobile device is probably the most secure computing device you own. Of course you can still get a virus / keylogger on your phone, it is just less of a vector than a PC (for now). Again you will have complete control over your keys and bitcoin. They are easy to download (available in app stores). They are mostly pretty safe. Make sure you keep the seed words (12 or 24 words) in a safe place. They should never be in digital form. These seed words are how your keys are created, if you lose them, you cannot recover your wallet. No one will be able to help you. I would personally not feel comfortable with more that $1000 or so on a mobile wallet, but your risk profile might be different than mine.\n\nThis brings us to **Hardware Wallets**. Examples are Ledger Nano and Trezor. These are specialty devices that take an input (your seed words) and provide an output (your keys -- although you will never see the keys). The keys never leave the device, and these are some of the more secure ways to protect your coins. The disadvantage is that they are expensive ($100 range), and they take a little understanding. Again you will get some seed words which you need to keep safe. If something happens to your hardware wallet, you will need these words to recover. Without the words you cannot recover your wallet. A lot of these wallets can store several different types of crypto's.\n\nFinally, you have **paper wallets**. This is just getting on a computer that is clean (so boot from an Ubuntu ISO or something) and create a wallet offline by using something like this (https://www.coindesk.com/information/paper-wallet-tutorial/)\n\nAnother option (much like a paper wallet) is to install a mobile wallet, get the seed words and generate a bunch of public keys. Then wipe it from your phone. You can then send bitcoin to the public keys for years and years, but you will need to load the wallet from the seed words to spend it. This is sort of like a paper wallet. Again, make sure your seed words are safe and test your recovery before you put much on it.", 28], ["2017-12-21 08:08:31", "**Wallet recommendations:**\n\nStore it in a segwit wallet for better security and much less expensive transaction fees saving 30-50% off fees for the same confirmation priority.\n\n**Wallets with segwit:** armory, trezor, ledger, Green address , Greenbits, Samourai wallet , core (manually) \n\n", 4], ["2017-12-21 04:52:13", "Ledger Nano S.

Anyone that was old enough around the year 2000 to remember AOL, Netscape, Myspace, etc would've incorrectly thought that those companies were going to dominate the market forever because of their enormous market share that they started out with. The problem with this type of thinking when it comes to technology is that being first means that you are the oldest. No one wants the oldest technology. That means that competition will get to learn from your mistakes and, due to the nature of things on the internet, can easily catch up to where you are and surpass you because they aren't bogged down by an established company's ways of doing things. This is counterintuitive for us that watch the way other companies and products have been successful in the past but that's because internet based technology works in a completely different manner than companies that build and deliver physical products.

The more users are in the system, the more demand per coin, so the value increases.\n\nFiat currencies (Euro, USD, etc) have the same pressures as Bitcoin. However, while the quantity of BTC is limited, these currencies can be extended at will by the governments that control them. A dollar has no inherent value, and really hasn't since the 1930s.\n\nThe value of a Euro can also be expressed in terms of USD. That does not mean that the Euro is \"built on the dollar\". It is merely and expression of supply/demand of the Euro relative to the supply/demand of the dollar. \n\nWhen you say that BTC is worth X dollars is nothing more than expression of the relative supply/demand of each. \n\nCurrently it is much easier to spend fiat currencies, so it is useful to track BTC price in your local currency (whether it is USD or whatever) because you'll probably have to convert BTC into fiat in order to spend it in the real world.\n\nBecause it is independent of any fiat currency, BTC is actually built on top of *all* fiat currencies, not merely USD (you can convert BTC to any currency you choose). This is similar to gold, and why gold has historically been used as a hedge against inflation. The deflationary nature of BTC makes it a suitable substitute for gold in hedging against the inflationary nature of fiat currency.\n\nShould USD suddenly be subject to annual inflation of 10 or 20 or 100% BTC would likely be worth much more than 11K, however it's world-wide value (ie: purchasing power) would be (relatively) unchanged because there's a lot more fiat aside from USD in the world.\n\nMoney is a fascinating subject, it really is.", 3], ["2017-12-06 08:28:55", "Because you are here to buy some.", 2], ["2017-12-06 07:42:37", "True, it's an investment until it's widely enough used that the price stabilises..

BitShares is the world's first (but no longer only) successful Decentralized Autonomous Company - A bank & exchange (on a blockchain, of course); it was the world's first decentralized exchange, and is still one of the best (if not the best). To date, it is the only cryptocurrency that can scale - stress testing on its TestNet sustained 3300tx/sec [Source (Warning: PDF)](http://docs.bitshares.eu/_downloads/bitshares-stresstest.pdf). It also solves the problem of volatility - a significant barrier to merchant adoption, with market-pegged price-stable assets (such as bitUSD) that are fully collateralized and completely free of counterparty trust. Other notable features include 3-second confirmations (50 seconds until a tx is completely irreversible - on Bitcoin such a level of security takes 6 blocks, roughly an hour), the ability to trade other cryptos on the DEX via gateways such as OpenLedger, and user issued assets on the blockchain. Its consensus mechanism is far more agile than proof of work, allowing for upgrades via hardfork (when necessary) without the risk of a chain-split - and enabling its 3-second block rate. There is also a very distinct possibility that it will become the first cryptocurrency system to have figured out how to successfully market & sell crypto to Joe the Plumber, all of his friends, all of their friends, etc.\n\n[News about it and more](https://steemit.com/trending/bitshares).", 1], ["2017-09-12 05:50:23", "I have historically told people they should invest $500 or 3% of their net worth in Bitcoin, whichever is *higher*.

I've lately recommended no one invest in Bitcoin without a hardware wallet or their own cold storage format, regardless of how ridiculous it might be (even [Glacier](https://glacierprotocol.org/), a super secure but expensive and long process, is worth considering depending on your technical skill).\n\nI would not be surprised if the SegWit2x stuff just fades, if Bcash just fades, etc. and we see exponential growth by the end of the year or start of next year.

I'm not sure where this anti-theymos stuff comes from, or why Blockstream is so often vilified, but someone appears to have a financial interest in splintering the Bitcoin community over some form of astroturfed support for things like Bitcoin Cash and 2x.

Unless a new vein was discovered or a shitload of booty was seized, the price of gold and silver went steadily higher and bullion was concentrated into fewer and fewer hands.

Let's just use '123' for simplicity. \n\nIf the coins always went to this address, then no matter when you made the backup, your wallet will always contain all coins (present, future, past) sent to that wallet. Because all the wallet is doing is having ownership of a certain address. As long as you have the private key to a public address, you can have all the coins in it.\n\nThe wallet doesn't keep track of how many coins go into its addresses. Thats what the blockchain is for. So if I backed up that wallet when it had 0 coins, and then won the lotto and put 10000 BTC inside of it, and then lost it, I could still get the coins by using the backup.\n\nAn analogy would be like saying \"If I lose my debit card, but get a new one while someone sent my account a check, would I have access to those funds?\". Yes because all the debit card is doing is pointing to your account. \n\nThe difference here is that Bitcoin-qt has the option of creating many 'accounts' (addresses). This is why backups are needed.

That's why it has to sync with the network. What its doing is reading the list and finding out how many coins it has in its addresses. \n\nThere is room for user error, which is why I prefer Electrum.

The first number is the public address, which is basically the locker number. The second number is the private key, which is the code to get into the locker, and spend what is inside of it.

It keeps all the addresses that you generate. \n\nSo in your case, if you only use one address, you will never lose your coins as long as you keep your wallet file safe.

(Cue the illunmanti music ~ not serious) ", 3], ["2018-03-16 18:50:53", "The same thing happened to my Suntrust accounts - and it happened the SAME week as the OP.   I signed into reddit to see if there was any advice regarding my funds I have yet to receive from the five accounts Suntrust closed.    On the day the freeze began their painfully slow closing process, I had five accounts with a combined available balance of around $70K.  Their \"closing process\u201d locked up all my funds since that date in January and the final closing occurred Feb 12 (as stated the February statements I received in the mail yesterday).  This was my only retail bank, all my debits cards were tied to it and my only way to pay my personal expenses.   I would have never guessed what was to come, as I'd been inside my home Suntrust branch the day before to sign a linking form to from my personal to my business account.   I could have withdrawn all my money that day had I any clue what would occur the next day, but there was ZERO indication of a problem. In fact, the manager tried to get me to sign up for a new money market product that day (which I declined).  Then when my debit card would not work the following day, I called SunTrust to report this and was shocked when I received a curt and rude response that my accounts were in the process of being closed and I would not have access to my funds until the closing process was complete   They refused to tell me why, stating that under terms of their deposit agreement, they had the right to close any account for any reason, that they could do so at any time without prior warning and had no obligation disclose the reason for such closure.\n\nI suspected it was due to a \"second pass chex review\" just like other accounts of mine had been abruptly closed over the past year after I became a victim of ID Theft 2 years ago which destroyed my credit score and chex report almost overnight.   Even though the ID theft had stopped, all the subsequent banks I'd opened closed my accounts shortly after opening them (even though no problems happened- citing their \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to close the accounts they had just approved, based on a \u201csecond pass review of my chex report\u201d).  I couldn\u2019t afford this to happen again, so when opening my accounts at SunTrust last September, I explained what had happened with the ID theft, gave them a copy of the police report I\u2019d filed, as well as all my former credit reports showing a 20 year history of near perfect credit and 820+ credit score (pre-ID theft).  It was obvious that something had happened TO me, as it came about abruptly, bared no resemblance of my banking and credit profile of the 20 years prior, accounts had been opened in states I'd never lived in or visited, credit cards had been opened and shipped overseas and the forensic expert the police used to find the source discovered it my computer had been infected with a keylogger (which explained why my passwords were constantly being rehanged and accounts breached even after I'd close and reopen new account numbers).  Even worse, once I'd tossed my old PC, locked down my domain of my law firm and shut out the hackers, I began receiving a series of extortion threats naming my family, my parents address, my children's names, ect, unless I wired $30,000 to their account.   My case was then escalated up to the FBI cybercrimes unit and designated as a felony threat and extortion case.   I showed all of this documentation to Suntrust and the branch manager assured me they understood, opened the accounts and I'd had no issues whatsoever prior to the abrupt closure.  \n\nIronically, I've been a finance attorney for 15 years, and my records within the bar associations of the three states of which I'm a member are not only in good standing, but after 15 years remain pristine, without complaint, any ethical inquiry or other indicator of fraudulent behavior - which I assure you would NOT be the case if I had engaged in such practices.   I have represented most of the major banks for years in transactional and compliance matters and the fact that these banks refuse to approve a simple personal checking account for me, yet entrust me to advise them on sophisticated compliance matters is not only absurd, but a slap in the face making me want to give up on banking for good- but of course I cannot.  Nonetheless, something needs to change radically to fix the broken & misleading ways banks report fraud on chex reports.  What I have found is that victims of fraud are basically indistinguishable from their perpetrators on chex reports.   I was a victim that lost tens of thousands of dollars due to a crime that happened TO me, based in part on the banks failure of their fiduciary duty to protect my funds.  I continue to suffer for it to this day, without recourse, due to the banks\u2019 lazy and incompetent reporting on chex profiles.  Further, Banks are unwilling to employ reasonable discretion in the course of the application process, and in the off chance they do, they fail to continue to use the same discretion when making decisions having enormous consequence to those who have entrusted their funds in their institution.\n\nI still have not received a dime of the $70K that was available in my accounts the day before the closing process began.  My \"closing statements\" received in the mail yesterday showed no activity from the time they \"began their closing process\" until the final \"closing debits\" from each account, which all occurred on the same day- February 12th.    I've called so many times it feels like defeating and a futile effort.  I don't know why I posted my story but felt compelled to share it when I saw the OP's post AND that it literally occurred the SAME week it happened to me.

Some large users are dragging their feet, meaning we aren't getting the full benefit yet.\n\nThe controversy seems to have come initially from the large mining hardware provider Bitmain, who were using a technique called stealth ASICBoost to mine more effectively, and hiding it.  Turns out segwit broke that, and they spent months complaining for all kinds of (turns out) spurious reasons.\n\nSome of the weird anti-segwit claims you see today are remnants of that campaign (which resulted in bcash, whose supporters take it as assured that segwit is evil, flawed, or worse) Others have more valid complaints about how it's not being adopted fast enough...\n\nDisclaimer: I work with Pieter Wuille who implemented segwit in Bitcoin Core, and I've implemented parts of it for lightning.", 28], ["2017-12-26 16:15:09", "Segwit moves the transaction signatures (the \"witness data\") from the transactions to somewhere else. Hence \"segregated witness\".\n\nThe benefits of doing so are that transaction signatures now don't count towards the 1MB blocksize limit and so, as long as you use a segwit wallet, you can have lower fees for your transactions (on a blockchain whose block space is limited, as is the case for BTC currently) and, as long as everyone uses segwit, the network can handle (on average) 1.7 times more transactions. (If everyone were using Many-Input transactions that have more signature data then the ratio increases towards a max increase of 4 times more transactions. But segwit is still under 15% adoption, and has done a negligible amount to scale Bitcoin even months after its release.)\n\nIt also fixes transaction malleability, which wasn't a huge problem and was, as I understand it, easily fixable in many ways via a hard fork but, since some consider hard forks to be dangerous, to do it with a soft fork could be argued as being a benefit.\n\nThe controversy comes from two angles.\n\nOne is that it arguably weakens Bitcoin's security model. Because it removes the transaction signatures from the transactions themselves, this opens up the Bitcoin network to an attack where miners could be financially incentivized to not validate the segregated witness data. Peter Rizun gives a good [talk on this point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoFb3mcxluY&t=1393s).\n\nThe other is that it was sold as a scaling solution, when many members of the Bitcoin community considered a blocksize-limit increase to be the most obvious scaling solution. (Bitcoin's blocks had been increasing in size for its entire existence with no negative repercussions, and it had only reached artificially imposed blocksize limit recently, which was only introduced in the first place as an anti-spam/anti-ddos measure.

They are against the lies and deceit behind it, which forces mistrust.\n\nA common misconception is that Bitcoin Cash can't have Lightning Network because you **need** SegWit. That isn't true - you just need a malleability fix. There are other ways to do this without removing signatures from transactions in a quick hack because you don't like people using ASICBoost. Also Malleability isn't a large issue as some people make out - it's been around in Bitcoin since the beginning and is somewhat ingrained into the system - there's other ways to fix it though that can be tried and tested before implementation thanks to a simple blocksize increase to cope with congestion immediately at a very small trade-off.\n\n[The Bitcoin Core dev team is very centralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7lio87/debunking_blockstream_is_3_or_4_developers_out_of/?st=jbjbo1gr&sh=4c649056) and controlled. Increasing block sizes to allow for more transactions was never controversial until Blockstream came on the scenes 3 years ago, since then those who joined the Blockstream (and associated companies) payroll all came round to the idea that blocksize increases are bad and there has to be another way.\n\nThey assured everyone that [SegWit was the solution to the problem immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sENj4hnCNgo), saying it had massive consensus and was ready for adoption. It's sat at 14% adoption rate which as resulted in a massive blocksize 'increase' from 1 MB to 1.06 MB. It's done nothing to help the problem, there's still 140,000 transactions in the mempool waiting to be processed, with average fees climbing down to just $40 per transaction.\n\nThe next claim is that everyone who hasn't adopted SegWit is causing BTC to fail and they are enemies of BTC. As of yet, here's the github code commit for SegWit to the [Bitcoin Core wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11403) which remains un-merged. Not even Core are making the commit for some reason.\n\nAs for ASICBoost, it's a patented technology that allows the user to speed up mining. That much is true. Lots of people don't like this because it isn't 'open source', but then go on to support Blockstream who are a \"for profit side-chain company\" with multiple patents in side-chain technology, that they have said they intend to sell off to make profit.\n\nSide-chains are required when the initial layer is full - so Blockstream will directly profit from network congestion. This is another reason that I don't trust their implementation of it. Couple this with their [history of terrible actions](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=j87bbmr0&sh=425fc26f) including targeted bullying, harassment, & threats, rampant censorship, literal [full-time paid teams](https://twitter.com/Egon_01/status/944090375718875136) of shills, social engineering attacks, ostracizing any part (up to 90% as stated) of the community that disagrees with them... The list goes on, I actually don't remember half the stuff they've done, and this is only the stuff they do in public.\n\nPersonally, I cannot put my trust in this company to run Bitcoin.

Both chains survive, there's no reason why they wouldn't.\n\nTo keep the terminology clear: a *hard fork* is when the rules of bitcoin change. Hard forks require *consensus* from all users to work. If some users don't agree with the hard fork they can stay on the old chain and then both the old and the new chain will live.\n\nB2X (aka Segwit2X) is not a *hard fork* but a *hard fork attempt*. It doesn't have consensus so it will fail, instead it will result in two currencies going their separate ways. Right now the futures market is showing that B2X coins trade at 12% of the value of bitcoins, so it's clear that the bulk of value and liquidity will stay with the original bitcoin. But make sure you don't use a lightweight wallet which may be tricking into accepting B2X coins instead of bitcoins.\n\n> While we're at it, what power do non-miner nodes have over miners?\n\nThe economy using full nodes has a lot of power over miners.\n\nFull nodes (short for fully-verifying nodes) check all the rules of bitcoin. If bitcoin is digital gold then a full node wallet is your own personal goldsmith which checks that you haven't been tricked into accepting fake bitcoins. People which use full nodes as their wallets have a say on the *validity* of bitcoin. Miners have a say over the *history of transactions*.\n\n[Look up the UASF movement](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/long-road-segwit-how-bitcoins-biggest-protocol-upgrade-became-reality/) from this summer which made the segwit update become activated even though miners had been blocking it for 9 months before that.

But there is little rationality going on in bitcoin at the moment.\n\nNon-miner nodes carn't really do that much.

It was a Bitcoin soft fork, which means that it was a change to the software that caused changes in the way the network functioned, but allowed nodes that didn't upgrade the newer version of the software to not split off from the network. You can think of a soft fork as being \"backwards compatible\".\n\nIn bitcoin transactions, there is a part called the \"witness data\" which, if I understand it correctly, is the cryptographic signature that verifies the transaction itself. (It's generated using the transaction and your private key. Anyone else could try to make a transaction from you to them, but without your private key they couldn't sign it.)\n\nThe witness data takes up a significant percentage of the transaction space in blocks. Segwit allows you to remove it from the transaction and puts it elsewhere. This makes your transaction effectively smaller, which allows for more transactions to fit into 1MB of block space and, if blocks are full, lets you pay a lower fee (since you're taking up a smaller amount of space for which there is already demand from other users.) In order to take advantage of segwit, you need first to send your funds to a segwit wallet (which not all wallets support). Sending from that new wallet will give you the benefits of lower fees or faster transaction confirmation.\n\nThe history of segwit is weird. It's an \"effective blocksize increase\" in that it lets you fit more transactions in the blocks, without having to actually increase the max blocksize (which would require a hard fork, where nodes that don't upgrade split off from the network of nodes that do.) The benefit of soft forks over hard forks, however, is [debatable](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7).\n\n>[Soft forks have the benefit of not requiring everybody to upgrade at the same time. The trick is to add rules to part of the protocol that existing software will consider valid regardless.\nDoing upgrades in such a way is significantly simpler, but has a significant drawback that it drastically limits the design space of the new features. This results in a higher level of complexity and sometimes tradeoffs that one would not usually accept if designing the system from scratch.](https://www.yours.org/content/creating-an-extensible-blockchain-protocol-46dc105c8cfd)\n\nSome would argue that segwit was forced onto users by the Bitcoin Core developers, and that it would have never been activated if Segwit2X hadn't existed. Segwit2X was a plan that made a compromise: activate segwit, which the developers (and users who blindly trusted the developers) wanted, but also increase the max block size in a hard fork some time later, which many users and >90% of miners wanted. The 2X hard fork never happened, however, after an enourmous campaign to discredit and cancel it... which started once segwit was activated.\n\nThere have been arguments that segwit [hurts bitcoin's security model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoFb3mcxluY), though the long term consequences thereof are unclear.", 7], ["2017-12-03 02:53:34", "For a non-technical user, the main feature of segwit address is that transactions from it are effectively smaller in size (via witness discount), thus cheaper because the fee depends on the transaction size. Typical transaction (1 input/2 outputs) is 226 bytes, with segwit discount it is either 166 bytes, i.e. 27% less (addresses starting with 3), or 141 bytes, i.e. 38% less (new bech32 addresses starting with bc). Larger and more complicated transactions benefit even more. \n\nThere are a lot of other benefits important for the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. They are very well (though a bit technical) [described here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/).\n\n1. Maleability fixes greatly help in any second-layer solutions on top of Bitcoin, such as [Lightning Network](https://medium.com/@AudunGulbrands1/lightning-faq-67bd2b957d70).\n\n2. Large complicated segwit transaction are easier to verify by Bitcoin nodes. Since running a full Bitcoin node that provides everybody security is fairly disk/CPU/bandwidth-intensive, any relief helps  the operators and prevents them from stopping the service. \n\n3. Multisignature Segwit transactions have better security due to the use of 256-bit hash. Non-Segwit multisignature transactions currently rely on a 160-bit hash. A malicious party in the multisignature transactions can create a key by using 2^80 operations (it's a square root of 2^160) that will enable to steal the funds from the other party. 2^80 operations is still a lot but if all the miners stopped mining and made these 2^80 operations, they would be able to do it in about 34 hours now. 20% of the hashrate (e.g, the largest pool) can do it in 7 days. This is still a lot and the attack is rather theoretical than practical but in a year of two it may become a matter of hours. 256-bit hash requires 2^128 operations and it would take the current miners 10 trillion years to crack it so we are safe. Multisignature are used by, e.g. exchanges and are a part of, e.g. Lightning Network. \n\n4. Segwit is extensible, the witness part have a version number and it is possible to update Bitcoin by a relatively simple soft fork to, e.g. [Schnorr signatures](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496/) that are much more efficient for large transactions.\n\n", 9], ["2017-12-03 05:15:58", "Segwit is supposed to be a way to make bitcoin transactions faster.

More selling value than buying volume will eat up the buy wall in the order book, more buying power than selling will eat up the sell orders and let the price move up easier.\n\nWithout the standing order placing resistance at different level the price can be driven further easier.

I don't know enough about segwit to recommend it or not.\n\n\"Sweeping\" is the way that you send the contents of a *paper wallet* to another wallet, but with Exodus (which I'm assuming is an online wallet) you would just make an ordinary send transaction from Exodus to a receiving address in your Electrum wallet.\n\nSo the answer to your second question is yes.  Your Electrum wallet and all the bitcoin that you put into this wallet, including that sent from Exodus, will be recoverable by the seed.  \n\nThere are helpful instructions on using Electrum here:\n\nhttps://bitzuma.com/posts/a-beginners-guide-to-the-electrum-bitcoin-wallet/\n\nThe instruction in this guide on sweeping a paper wallet by importing its private key are out-of-date.  On page 13 under \"Sweep a Paper Wallet\" instructions say to click on \"Wallet\" then select \"Import.\"  This option no longer exists, and in place of \"Import\" is the \"Sweep\" option, so I'm assuming that Electrum has automated the *Sweep* process and automatically performs all 3 steps, aka importing the paper wallet's private key, transfering bitcoin from paper wallet to Electrum, and internally moving this bitcoin to a new address with a new private key.\n\nIf you were to simply import the private key to a paper wallet into another wallet (as opposed to going through the whole sweeping process), then the bitcoin would still be connected to the private key of the paper wallet, so I think this is where your question about sweeping and private keys is coming from. But Exodus is not a paper wallet, and, even if you were to sweep a paper wallet into Electrum, the sweep process is now automated, so basically all the bitcoin in your Electrum will be in addresses with their own private keys regardless of where they came from, and so are protected by the seed.\n\nI hope this helps.  Also, be sure you downloaded Electrum from: https://electrum.org/\n\nThere is a scam site to avoid, described here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7e2s33/warning_a_fake_electrum_client_is_being/", 1], ["2017-11-18 08:56:12", "I meant a bitcoin wallet that is just a wallet, not also a conduit for shapeshift etc.  I use Electrum.  https://electrum.org/#home All it does is give me the ability to send or receive bitcoin.\n\n> I don't know how high fees are elsewhere\n\nThat's the thing though, a regular old bitcoin wallet does not charge you any fees.

Also, unless you are careful to split your coins, and do some fairly esoteric things requiring a lot of technical knowledge, then transactions on one chain will be considered valid (and may be mined) on the other chain.\n\nThe only chance of preventing a chain split on August 1st is if the efforts to write and deploy code consistent with the *New York consensus* can happen before then, and Segwit locks in with miner support so that the UASF doesn't happpen.\n\nFailing that, as we approach August 1st, and certainly when the chain split actually occurs, I expect the price of Bitcoin to plummet due to the uncertainty and toxic fallout from the events likely to follow.

For instance, some sort of event in the Middle East would have an impact on Oil prices regardless of the medium of exchange.\n\nIf a country had some sort of political upheaval the price of their bonds would still drop, no matter if these bonds were priced in USD or bitcoins.\n\n\nMore people using bitcoin would help with the wild price swings, only if you have an equal number of people looking to buy bitcoin as you do those looking to sell.\n\nThe Bitcoin community encourages everyone to hold onto their Bitcoins which causes a strain on liquidity. This causes the volatility. Too many buyers, not enough sellers, fast rise in price. \n\nProblem is that when the tide turns and those that were holding are ready to sell there's then no buyers. Causing the hard crash.\n\nThe bitcoin community needs to encourage both the buying and selling of bitcoins.\n\nYou want a slow, gradual increase in value of Bitcoin. Once the market can establish a fair baseline price for a BTC that is tied to the value of the resources needed to create it (electricity) then it may gain some stability.\n\nIf you want my opinion I think the price will stabilize at around the $4,000-5,000 mark. [As this is the average cost of electricity to generate 1 BTC in the USA.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-one-chart-heres-how-much-it-costs-to-mine-bitcoin-in-your-state-2017-12-15) \n\nOf course, Bitcoin is traded internationally and it may be cheaper to mine bitcoin in other countries but I feel the US provides a nice guess, and its the only information I could find on the subject.\n\nEdit: In general your comment on volatility is correct in that a larger market is less volatile. But I think some of Bitcoin's current issues also stem from the mindset of many of its investors in that many will outright refuse to sell regardless of its price for philosophical reasonings (Many I agree with by the way, however, I feel gold is the better bet). This makes the market more volatile than it other would be otherwise.\n\nEdit: Edit: Everytime you saw bitcoin take a big dip and quickly rebound quickly over the last month or 2 was the people who were pumping it up getting out of it while all the noobs were flooding in. It was a classic pump and dump. The sad thing is that EVERYONE was in on it, look back and think about how many bitcoin frenzy articles and news stories there were.

The idea is that if a thief finds only one piece, they can't get to your money. And if you lose just one piece, you can still use the remaining pieces to recover your money. There are different ways to do this:\n\n1. Have an encrypted paper wallet and a passphrase. You can, for example, store the encrypted paper wallet in a Gmail account and in a Dropbox account. Then you memorize the passphrase and also keep a copy in your firebox. And maybe even give a copy of your passphrase to a friend or family member to keep safe in a different place. Make sure to set up Google Inactive Account Manager so your family can get the encrypted wallet from your Google account if you pass away. And leave instructions for how to cash out the bitcoins.\n\n2. Use multisig. For example use Copay to make a 2 of 3 wallet. Then you have 3 master keys and any 2 (but not 1) give access to the money. Or use a multisig service like BitGo where one of the keys is held by a company behind 2FA.\n\n3. Use a hardware wallet with a pin that wipes its data if the pin is entered wrong 3 times. I know Ledge Nano S does this and I assume Trezor too. Then split 2 copies of the 24 word master seed into 2 pieces of 12 words each and keep them in 4 separate places.\n\nIn each case the key is to have no single point of failure, either in case of theft or loss.

You can also use waterproof paper / inks.\n\nWith the hardware devices, the key is stored on the device. A random seed (that the key can be generated from) can be stored on paper, as a backup in case of device failure. You need to secure this as well as you would a key. The major advantage of these devices over paper wallets is for bitcoins you would like to use periodically; for very-long-term cold storage I don't see a huge advantage.\n\nConsider a safety deposit box for your (BIP-38 encrypted) paper wallet backups.

You could photograph them. You could hide the keys inside other files. You could engrave them on a rock and bury it in your garden.

Here's a great place to do it, because you can download and run the site locally: https://coinb.in/#newMultiSig\n\nThe 15 keys could be dispersed as above, and a thief would need to find them ALL to steal your coins.

Trezor is a little nicer, but its about $100 for a Trezor.  Ledger wallets are a lot more affordable, but they don't have a screen.  You can also get an OTG adapter to use them with smartphones.  Also check out the gyft.com ap on your phone you can use Bitcoin to buy gift cards at hundreds of locations.\n\nYou don't have to go the hardware wallet route though if you want to try cold storage instead.  But you have to be technical enough to create a bootable operating system onto a flash drive.  Usually people use a free linux distribution like ubuntu or TAILS to do it.  You will boot your computer into the USB drive instead of your hard drive.  This way when you create the keys it will be an offline environment without ever being stored onto your hard drive where hackers could possibly find it.

Just be aware that it's a wiki, which means that anyone can edit it, so you don't want to instantly trust services linked from it. You need to do your own investigation about the service's reputation before getting involved with them. You can search google, reddit, or just ask. Here's a link to their [FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ) too. I learned a lot just by reading and asking questions, but it took a week or two until I got up to speed, so be patient.\n\nArmory is a great choice for experienced users. The problem with beginners using it is that it's generally overkill, and it requires downloading the entire blockchain using Bitcoin QT which can take several days and is intended for running a full node. At 20 GB+, that's not exactly ideal for people just starting out. I'd highly recommend [Electrum](https://electrum.org/). It's not pretty, but it functions very well. It doesn't require downloading the blockchain, and it's 'deterministic', which means that all your bitcoin addresses can be backed up by simply writing down the generated 12-word seed that it generates when you first open it. Keep your seed in a safe place!\n\nYes, pretty much everyone buys their bitcoins from a bitcoin exchange. If you're in the US, you could use Coinbase (not really an exchange, more of a market I guess) or Kraken. Otherwise, you could use Bitstamp, which is probably the largest exchange right now. You would need to verify your identity with the exchange due to AML/KYC laws, which includes providing photo ID and bank statements or something similar. Once you're verified, you can send USD to the exchange and use it to purchase bitcoin. At that point, you can withdraw your bitcoin to your own private address. I highly suggest practicing all transactions with small amounts until you get the feel for it!\n\nMost people have several wallets. There are generally three layers.\n\n1. Mobile wallets. For Android, there's Mycelium. For iOS, there's bitWallet. Mobile wallets are used for daily spending when you're out and about, so don't keep all your bitcoins on them! Treat it like a physical wallet that you don't keep more than $100-200 in at a time.\n\n2. Desktop wallets. Electrum, Multibit, Armory, BitcoinQT. You could keep a bit more money in these, provided your computer is not compromised. Always make sure you're using a strong password, preferably 10-12 completely random words. You can use desktop wallets for spending money online, but since it's networked, you still don't want to keep your entire stash in there.\n\n3. Cold storage. These are generally paper wallets generated with an offline computer, or an installation of a desktop wallet on a dedicated **offline** computer. The point is to create an airgap between your bitcoins (private keys, specifically) and the internet. This makes theft considerably more difficult. For amounts less than a couple hundred, you don't need to worry about cold storage yet, but definitely include it in your research!\n\nHere's a few bits for you to play around with since it's difficult to practice with an empty wallet. Keep in mind that the default transaction fee is generally .0001 BTC, or about $.06, so your funds will gradually deplete with each transaction.

Bitcoin uses a blockchain. The blockchain is a public ledger, basically a list of all accounts and transactions. Everyone can see all accounts, all balances and all transactions for everyone.\n\nTo put bitcoins into an account you only need the account address. To take money out of an account you need a private key. A wallet is just a program that takes care of your account address and your private key. There are not bitcoins *in* your wallet. Just the public address and the private key. When your wallet shows you how many bitcoins you have, it takes your public address and looks into the blockchain to see your account balance.\n\nWhen you want to transfer bitcoins to someone else, you create a transaction with your private key. The transaction basically says \"Transfer X bitcoins from my address to this address\". Your private key is used to prove that it really is your address. This transaction is then sent out on the internet where everyone can see it.\n\nBitcoin miners listen on the internet for new transactions. They make a list of all the new transactions they found and put them together in a block. Then they have to calculate some complex sums to make sure the block is good. The first miner to do the sums correctly gets a bonus of 25 bitcoins. Then the block is added to the blockchain. Your transaction is now processed and the account balances are updated.\n\nThat's pretty much all there is to bitcoin.\n\nIf you understand this story then many basic questions about security and privacy also become easy. Some examples:\n\nWallet theft:\n\nWhen someone steals your wallet they are not stealing the bitcoins. They are stealing your private key. They can use your private key to make a transaction from your account to their own account. This is why a backup of your wallet doesn't protect you against theft. The bitcoins are not in your wallet.\n\nWallet loss:\n\nWhen you loose your wallet your private key is gone. That means that you cannot create a transaction anymore. Your bitcoins are still in your account but you cannot use them anymore. This is why you make backups. You want to have your private key even if your house burns down.\n\nTransaction error:\n\nIf you make a transaction to the wrong address then the same thing happens. Nobody has a wallet with the private key for the bad address you used, so nobody can use those bitcoins.\n\nWe also need to talk about privacy for a bit. At first sight it doesn't look very good that everyone can see everyone's account. It's not private at all. To help with this, many bitcoin wallets use *change addresses*. Basically, after every transaction you make, you get a new account address and a new private key. For example, say you have 1 BTC and you send 0.3 BTC to your friend. Your transaction looks like this:\n\n    Transfer 0.3 BTC from my address to your friends address\n    Transfer 0.7 BTC from my address to my new address\n\nYour old address is now empty. After a while your wallet contains hundreds of account addresses and private keys. Everyone can see how much bitcoins there are at an address, but nobody knows all the addresses you own. In the transaction above, nobody knows which address is your new address and which address belongs to your friend. This is what makes bitcoins private. There are so many addresses and transactions that it becomes impossible to find out which accounts belong to which person.", 6], ["2014-01-03 23:15:35", "Bitcoin is a means of trade by transferring value between public visible addresses and values and is authenticated using privately stored keys for each address.

Central wallet- sure, just pick one place and keep all your BTC there.  Just keep it secure (turn on two factor authentication).  Just be aware of the security risks (unlike a bank, if your account gets hacked and your BTC stolen, nobody will help you or refund the money).  Note that one wallet will have many addresses (the big long random-looking strings of letters and numbers).\n\n2. Buy bitcoins:  as before, coinbase.com.  Or if you want a lot, you can set up an account on an exchange like btc-e.com or mtgox.com and wire them money.  Or you can use a site like LocalBitcoins to find someone to do an exchange with in person.\n\n3. How long for them to be delivered:  This varies based on your purchase method.  In person is instant, you shouldn't walk away without your phone saying BTC is in your wallet.  Coinbase is instant up to certain amounts, after that it's 2-3 days.  Wire transfers to exchanges usually take about 24hrs but that depends on the exchange.\n\n4. Wallet to Wallet:  Just send the bitcoins from wherever they are to an address of the target wallet.  By this method it is VERY easy to transfer BTC between companies- I trade on btc-e.com, but I use Coinbase for buying and selling from my bank account for example.  \n\n5. How do you exchange Bitcoins for real money?  Same as you buy them.  Coinbase.com just hit the 'sell' button and your bitcoins will be converted to cash and deposited into your bank (the conversion is instant, the deposit takes 2-3 days).  With an exchange, either transfer them as BTC to coinbase and sell, or sell on the exchange and have the exchange wire you the money.

You have an account where you can immediately purchase without worrying if its gunna dip from the time you submitted your request to when you get your amount.\n\n\nNow here is where I suggest transfer to GDAX and learn GDAX.

Those who tend to play this game and don't really care about the main point of crypto tend to lose. The moment it begins to dip they give up and accept the lose. Only to be sore when weeks later it comes back. It comes back. No matter how much FUD it comes back.\n* If you don't want to understand the technology but want to be the investor. A post somewhere said that the smartest investor in the technology won't be to foresee a trend where they can avoid lost. The smartest investor HODLs (ps hodling just means to hold). Ignore the FUD and your heart will feel better if you dont constantly refresh and just let your investment sit and grow.\n* My best suggestion is to understand why crypto and what the technology. There's a little idiots that dont understand crypto and FUD, even here. They don't understand the argument so they think a lot of people here are babbling idiots, talking about that one idiocracy post where they acted like people only say decentralized.

This account has been funded. \n\n- Registered and verified on Bittrex for altcoins of my choosing (looking primarily at Ripple, Dash, Zcash). This account has been funded. \n\n- Purchases a Trezor on Amazon, which becomes available September 5th. \n\n- Set up Google Authenticator TOTP 2FA on iPhone for all activities on both exchanges, with a memorized \"master key\" for bypass and recovery.

From 0.20% to 3.99%...explain how? And what about how long it takes to process a transaction?

For example, I'm reading that the Trezor Chrome plug-in does not support ETH trading, but if I use MyEtherWallet then I can still store ETH keys on the Trezor.

The transaction throughput limit currently makes it unviable as a world currency.\n\n#4. How do I get it? \n\nBuy it from an exchange.

Do go read the sticky, top menus and linked ELI5's there.\n\nBut in a nutshell, cryptos are absolutely secure... as long as you and only you have the private keys to your wallets. Note that any wallet you do NOt have the key to, such as exchanges, are not yours and coins may be stolen, misappropriated or simply disappear if the service shuts down. Never leave coins unattended in such wallets for any longer than absolutely necessary.\n\nThere are wallet generators out there. One in particular handles nearly a hundred cryptos. You can run off bulk batches of wallets with a generator and use them as required. Note that wallets are simply numbers. No more and no less. Wallet **CLIENTS** are pieces of software which **contain** wallets, and they may impose severe limitations on functionality. So-called 'lite' wallets for example, will crash when trying to deal with lots of transactions, such as you might generate from a faucet for example.\n\nTo get coins, all the same methods apply as in the real world with fiat currencies. You can buy them, work for them, sell stuff, beg, or even steal them *(not recommended)*. Lots of people start off with faucets, although these give tiny amounts. Posting useful content in places that encourage tipping will likely get you coins too. And once you have some coins you can actively trade them, for fiat or other cryptos. Trading cryptos is actually a great way to learn about trading in general, as exactly the same principles apply as with any market, but the costs are next to nothing.\n\nWhile BTC IS indeed a finite currency, the plan is to progressively raise fees to compensate miners. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is infinite, and the 1 doge fee *(easily avoided at the moment)* is some 5,000 times cheaper than BTC. Because Doge and other Scrypt coins are merge-mined with Litecoin, mining them is basically cream on top of LTC earnings. There are no plans to increase fees currently.\n\nYou can use any crypto to buy anything, if you can find a willing counterparty to trade with. Recently when Australia released new polymer $5 notes, I offered them for sale for Doge at face value *(plus postage)*, and a number of collectors took advantage of the offer. If they had gone to eBay and used fiat through PayPal, it would have cost them at least twice as much. Note that crypto transactions are irreversible. Once coins are moved, there is no way to get them back without the private key of the wallet they were sent to. Because credit cards, paypal and other real-world transactions ARE reversible, this introduces an element of risk. There are ways to minimise such risks, such as using multisig wallets, where 3 or more parties are signatories, and a majority are required to sign to spend coins. Typically a buyer, seller and a trusted escrow agent would be used.\n\nHope this is a sufficient start. :)", 2], ["2017-01-03 11:30:22", "Are regular folks mining it anymore?

As far as I'm aware you'd have to craft the transaction yourself.\n\nThe thing to look at is \"NLockTime,\" which has a stub of a wiki page [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/NLockTime).  This is a parameter that is largely unused in transactions, but if you manually craft the transaction then you can set it to whatever you want.  A transaction with NLockTime set will not be valid until after a certain period of time.  To use this as a \"dead man's switch\" you would create a transaction that sends your coins to your heir using NLockTime set far enough in the future that it's convenient\u2014too short and you're going to have to replace it frequently; too long and it takes a while for them to inherit your coins.  If the time is approaching and you haven't died yet then you make a new transaction (not using NLockTime) and send the coins to a new address you control.  At that point the NLockTime transaction becomes invalid, since it's trying to send coins that were already sent.\n\nThis method is rather cumbersome right now, especially because you'd have to create a new NLockTime transaction every time you spend any of your coins.  It could be automated relatively easily by someone with enough knowledge of the code for a Bitcoin Wallet.\n\nYou may also be interested in looking at the [write-up for BIP65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki) which is somewhat similar.  Rather than creating a transaction that is not valid until some time in the future (while allowing other transactions to send the same coins) it makes coins unspendable until some time in the future.  You could set this up with a branching script that allows your family to spend the coins in X months or allows you to spend the coins immediately.  This achieves the same result in this case but it means that you just create one transaction each time you spend your coins instead of making two.  Last I heard BIP65 was on the verge of being activated, so it'll likely be up and running by the time you actually want to try it if it isn't already.

ELI5: Yes, all addresses \"exist\" already, and an address created completely offline will be valid as long as you give the correct address to the person sending to it. To spend it, you must have the corresponding private key (which was created at the same time as the Bitcoin address).\n\nELI1337: Basically, the bitcoin protocol is just a web of transactions, and not a list of balances. (ie. if you own address \"123\", it doesn't say \"123 balance = 0.1 BTC\" on the blockchain). So every time you calculate an addresses \"Balance\" in wallet software, what it's really doing is checking every single unspent transaction on the network for your address, and adding them up.\n\n(ie. imagine a bitcoin network with only 10 addresses, 0-9. Rather than writing down all addresses and their balances, the network starts with the genesis block, a transaction with no origin (it's like mining a block) that says \"send 50 BTC to address 3\". If Address 3 sent those 50 BTC to address five, the previous transaction is \"spent\" and the new transaction will become the only UNspent transaction, so when calculating the balance for each address, it will see the only unspent transaction being sent to 5, then it knows 5 has a 50 BTC balance and 3 has a 0 balance. This is crucial, as there are 1.4 Quindecillion addresses, that unit is 1 with 49 0s after it. Writing the balances of 99% of addresses as 0 would take up way too much space on the blockchain.)\n\n-2. Yes and No... There are 1.4 x 10^(49) addresses but over 1.2 x 10^(77) private keys. This means that more than one private key will come out to the same address. However, your chances are still one in 1.4 x 10^(49) which means that if you had a universe where the ground was flat and endless in every direction and you planted 10cm x 10cm boxes in the ground as \"bitcoin addresses\", the boxes, if placed perfectly next to each other into a large circle would have a diameter of 14.4 MILLION LIGHTYEARS! So yeah, if you ever generate an address that even has a HISTORY of EVER BEING USED. You just beat odds akin to winning 1 trillion lotteries in a row.\n\n-3. They wouldn't. The way the private/public key signing works is that your public key is generated from your private key, then your bitcoin address is generated with your public key. the Private and Public keys are 256 bit, but the bitcoin address hash is 160 bit. This means more than one public key (and private key) will come out to the same bitcoin address. Miners just verify that the signature is valid. They use the bitcoin address, the signature on the transaction, and the contents of the transaction to verify that the person signing it actually owns a private key that hashes out to that bitcoin address WITHOUT actually having to receive the private key.\n\n-4. Generating a Private Key from a Public Key is possible... it will just take trillions of years. Generating a Public Key from a Private Key takes less than a second. That's kind of the whole point of encryption.\n\n-5. The Vanity address program literally just randomly generates keys at however many keys per second, until it finds a match to the parameters you assign. Depending on the length of your requested letters and whether you require caps to be specific, the time to generate an address with up to 4 case insensitive letters may be a couple minutes on a slow computer, a few seconds on a fast GPU or something... but 5 case sensitive letters? We're looking at days. 6 case sensitive letters? Years.\n\nBut again, it's all probability, you may have a 0.0000001% chance of generating a 6 letter specified address within the first minute, but hey... if you're SUPER lucky... it could happen.\n\nEdit: I hate reddit formatting...", 11], ["2014-02-23 12:09:23", "You can use http://btcaddr.es to create a vanity bitcoin address.

On github, if you do that it is calling \"forking\" the code, like a fork in a path.\n\nIf the changes you make cause your version of bitcoin to generate blocks (batches of transactions) that the other software rejects, then the result will be two blockchains: the one from the \"original\" software, and the one that your software is generating/following. They'll share the same history though, up until the point where they split. And of course, if you do this by yourself and no one else run's your code, it's pretty pointless because your \"network\" is just you.\n\nThe fork called \"Bitcoin Cash\" has so much support because the current Bitcoin development team has deviated drastically from the original intent of Bitcoin as digital peer to peer electronic cash, mostly by refusing to increase the max blocksize as needed, thereby stifling growth and resulting in an unreliable network with high fees, but also by selling it as a \"settlement layer\" with plans for \"off-chain scaling\", which many users consider terrible ideas that do not reflect what Bitcoin has the potential to be.\n\nWhy exactly the Bitcoin Core developers have done this is not totally clear, but none of the reasons they've given hold up under scrutiny. (If you're curious as to what those reasons are and why they don't hold up, please let me know! It would just be too big of a wall of text if I dove into that here.)\n\nBitcoin Cash is an attempt to put the Bitcoin concept \"back on track\".
