It is paramount that the data posted by the oracle can be verified as genuine from the single trusted party, and not manipulated by the \"blockchain mailman\". Oraclize supports server signatures from APIs, but they cannot be verified (easily at least) on-chain and the signature should be from the data provider, not just their server API.\n\nOf cause there are all sorts of service, interface, scaling and gas-cost considerations to think about, but without the above any oracle solution would have been a non-starter for us.\n\nHope to see your product succeed! :)", 1], ["2018-02-15 13:05:27", "There are some things that smart contracts can't do without help from the outside.

There aren't good enough debugging tools, you can't even return complex data structures from the blockchain so must resort to fetching multiple addresses and making another batch request to fetch detailed info for each item, you can't store much on the blockchain, they say swarm will solve this problem but at this point they're pretty much busy what IPFS has been doing for the last couple of years and what makes it sadder is IPFS itself is far from usable. A lot of official libraries for accessing Ethereum (testrpc and web3.js) are still pretty much in early stages and have bugs and lack some crucial features, etc.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was there is extreme shortage of people actually working on improving these underlying technologies. Most people are selling the \"story\" (the stuff you read about in Blockchain pop science books that have become popular in the last couple of years) when it won't be anywhere near feasible at least for a couple of years. Which means most people who do these ICOs have not touched the low level blockchain code nor understand what's going on. This is probably why they are so out of touch (or another much more likely possibility is that they're conmen who do realize the limitations yet still push for it, but I think for the reasons I mentioned above there are only few of these people. Most people don't even understand the low level technology of blockchain and therefore have no understanding of its limitations)\n\nWhat I think will happen in the next few years is most of these ICOs will come crashing down, not just because they're scams, but even the legit ones will crash because the tech isn't just there yet and at least the legit ones will probably focus all their efforts on improving the infrastructure. But these things take time, and a lot of their employees will get burned out and move on, which is where the crash will come from.\n\nAnd after all these ICO orgs shut down, they will have left a legacy which is the improved infrastructure.

Since all the tokens created are 100% ERC-20 they can be transferred and traded independent of our app :). \n\n\nIf you would like to check it out, you can download the android version from the Play Store:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucidsight.cryptibles\n\n\nIf you're interested in beta testing our iOS app, send us a message and include your apple email.\n\n\nNow the good part:\n\n\nFor all those who would like to create their own ERC-20 token for free, the following code will redeem 11,500 of our in-app currency - CryptiBtyes - which will cover minting one set of Cryptible ERC-20 Tokens, transferring it to any ethereum address, and getting some additional packs of Cryptibles. The code is first come first serve and will allow 10 users to claim it before it expires.\n\nWe also have some really neat Cryptibles that our team has made, including a set for Halloween.\n\nCODE: 2j999hjky\n(To claim the FREE CryptiBytes go to \u201cINBOX\u201d in the app menu and select \u201cEnter Code\u201d)\n\nENJOY and please do send any and all feedback or suggestions.

If a bad actor chose to create a contract that can call your functions but has no callback (and so it can't accept ether sent to it) they could potentially lock up your contract when it tries to send ether.  Now I believe, THIS specific contract is safe as someone else could just be the 100th better, but keep it in mind.\n\nThe second which I think is an actual issue, is it looks like you take 10% and not 1% as you've stated in this thread.  I think this because you multiply the current bet (the amount each person needs to bet) by 9 and send that to the winner.  You multiply it by 1 and then send it to yourself.  For one, that only adds up to 10bet instead of the 100bet that should be in the contract.  The second is that even if the math is correct, it has you taking 10% instead of 1%.  Now maybe you deserve 10%, but I figured I'd point it out so you could decide whether to change the post or the contract ;).", 1], ["2018-03-29 20:55:59", "Thanks for the comment, really appreciate the positive feedback!

Then what, would he view what the playerKey is, edit his input + the time based off what the key is in order to find a number where the modulus would equal 99, to get 99 + 1 (100th player). Or would the miner essentially be buying any random ticket, recording what number they are, then when the last ticket comes through, ensure that the now time + the uint that was input is equal to a number where the modulus gives them the number they are (how would this math work? There's a lot more to look out for than I thought..)\n\nAs for transferring in the winning funds, definitely hearing you on that. On any other basis I've been using the withdrawal pattern, but I figured that if there were less money in the contract at any given time, it's less incentive for some evil genius to come up with the next reentrancy attack using my game.\n\nTrying to figure out what I would need to do to the RNG to make it less susceptible to miner interference, perhaps store all the playerKey inputs separately and concatenate them in a hard-to-predict way at the end(essentially just jumble the order up)? That way it isn't just 1 visible number that's used, but the first 100 keys of a mapping for example (all 100 bets).

And people recommend against using them. There are tons and tons of things in most programming languages you can do, but probably shouldn't. So you end up with things like this https://i.redd.it/h7nt4keyd7oy.jpg and it's not just JS, all languages have weird quirks and stupid features.\n\nWhat most people see in that image is a ton of extra stuff, and a ton of depth to js. What a blockchain developer should see when someone talks about using js as a blockchain language, is a small amount of \"good stuff\" and a huge surface area for compiler bugs, malicious libraries, confusing code, bad code, and endless application layer bugs.\n\nSolidity has relatively few features, and is very precise and explicit about everything. Which is good, when your talking about contracts that essentially can never be updated, and bugs can result in the loss of millions and millions of dollars.\n\nAlso, virtually all languages have support for floating point math, which is a problem for blockchain, because there are such things as floating point errors, which are hard to deal with and can be really hard to defensively program against. EG: https://gist.github.com/lsloan/f8c5ab552545ee968cca\n\nLooking at some projects, eg credits.com they claim they will support some prebuilt programming languages. IIRC it was going to be Java, or JS, which was the first thing that made me nope out (in addition to a bunch of other wildly ridicules claims, with no supporting evidence). Using a prebuilt language is not a feature, it's actually lazy, very lazy. Creating a new programming language is hard: The grammars are hard, the compiling is hard, optimization is hard, the AST traversal libraries are hard, the tooling is hard, the testing is hard, and the cost of mistakes is high. \n\nUsing a generic programming language which was not built with minimizing errors in mind: easy, lazy, and it's the end users who will pay for the laziness.\n", 1], ["2018-03-01 01:59:07", "A 14:1 capital:talent ratio might be a distinct advantage ;)", 1]]}, "214": {"created": "2018-02-21 22:45:34", "title": "Now Introducing EtherEstates: The Grandest Ethereum Collectibles Game!", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "215": {"created": "2018-02-21 03:29:18", "title": "Announcing the Wyvern Exchange: Any Ethereum asset, any ERC20 token, zero trust required", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "216": {"created": "2018-02-17 20:50:42", "title": "LMAO- Kim Jong-Un Collectibles", "num_comments": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2018-02-21 22:23:54", "LOL This just had to happen.\n\nI'll make a share to help spread it! ;)", 2]]}, "217": {"created": "2018-02-13 22:41:42", "title": "CryptoCuddles: A CryptoKitties Battle Game!", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "score": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "218": {"created": "2018-02-10 15:40:17", "title": "VectorZilla - Selling Stock Photography On The Blockchain", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "219": {"created": "2018-02-07 09:40:22", "title": "What is Sapien Network", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "220": {"created": "2018-02-06 03:40:00", "title": "Nucleus Vision: IOT based contactless identification system", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "221": {"created": "2018-02-02 21:48:00", "title": "Rare Bits (Beta Launch) - A new marketplace where users can buy, sell and discover crypto assets", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "222": {"created": "2018-01-14 17:15:43", "title": "I'm building a trading card game - let me know what you think", "num_comments": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "score": 1, "num_crossposts": 1, "comments": [["2018-01-15 03:51:49", "Definitely read it as \u201cMy Thik Cards\u201d.

And that is because, they are the only state that has a completely different court system for corporations. So these mega corporations, like Amazon, Jpmorgan Chase, Bank of America, etc are based there because their tons of legal cases are addresses quickly and by judges that specialize in business law.\n\nI honestly would recommend starting you business in the state you live in.

So each 100 BillionTix up to the Jackpot there is a giveaway.  \n\nSo 1 Billion drawings of the 100 level.  Same for the 1,000 giveaways...100Million giveaways of the 1,000 level.  For the 10,000 level there are 10 Million drawings.  For the 100,000 level giveaways, there are 1 Million of those....and just keep going until there is just one final mega giveaway that includes all BillionTix.\n\nWe run through some examples in the FAQ on our page.  So there is a giveaway at every hundred tickets sold during the entire game.  So you buy Billiontix 102, you have a 1/100 chance of winning the giveaway between tickets 100 and 200.  That same BillionTix...number 102 is then automatically entered and valid for tickets 1 thru 1,000...then 1 thru 10,000...then 1 thru 100,000...on up with increasing prizes each level.  You don't have to do anything but hold your ticket and hope you have good luck at each level.  Those are the prize levels.\n\nSo you buy BillionTix 1,567...you would be entered into the drawing of the 100 level of BillionTix 1,500 thru 1,600...then the next level of BillionTix 1,000 thru 2,000...then 1 thru 10,000...then 1 thru 100,000.  The payout for each level increases as the odds increase.\n\nSo what if you buy the very last BillionTix number 9,999,999,999?  You would be entered into the Giveaway between 9,999,999,900 and 10B..drawing 9,999,999,000 to 10B...Giveaway 9,999,990,000 to 10B...then 9,999,900,000 to 10B....etc all the way down to BillionTix 1 to 10B for the 500,000 Ether Jackpot.  \n\nSo even the very last ticket has the exact same chances as the first to win all of the prizes.\n\n\nHope this explains it better!  It is a cool concept and idea for a Giveaway that we hope people start to get.  I know we are new and this is a type of Giveaway never seen before!  For @ $0.50 a BillionTix right now, pick some up...they are pretty cheap while the market stays steady.\n\nTL;DR  One BillionTix is good at all levels and can win multiple prizes. \n The previous post was not correct about the Giveaway Levels.\n\nEven the very last ticket sold has the exact same chances as the first to win all of the available prizes.  The odds don't change and the payouts increase.  Read our FAQ at www.billiontix.com for more examples!  Or just read what we posted above.

However I can't claim to have deep knowledge of the protocol at such a level, so it's possible you might be right.  If such Crafty Dogs do become too common, that would be a bummer for the Underdogs, as the scraps are the primary means by which wealth gets redistributed downward class-wise from the wealthier Top Dog competitors, to balance the upward wealth redistribution built into the Top Dog dividend payout mechanism.

My third game was too complex. I've edited it and created something new. I think this one is also really interesting. Basically, what you can do here is that everyone is allowed to buy their own games into the game.\n\nGames there work really simple. You have a timer on a game. When someone buys the first item, the timer starts. If it is zero, the last owner wins and gets everything in the pot. For the first item, all payment go in the pot, so it's free to start a game. If someone else buys it then the timer will reset and he will pay an amount to the developer, to the creator of the item and to the previous owner. The rest of the payment goes into the jackpot. The price increases with a percentage for everyone who buys. \n\nI think the idea that people are allowed to add their own games is really nice and also got received very well. \n\nGame I'm talking about is [Item Market.](http://itemmarket.surge.sh/)\n\nYou can find me on [discord](https://discord.gg/R84hD6f) if you want to chat.
