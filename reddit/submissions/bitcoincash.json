However it cannot evolve because Bitcoin core are hell bent on keeping Bitcoin in its s crystallised original form and therefore cannot deal with the huge volume of transactions. As a result of this Bitcoin Cash has emerged (or forked) from Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash controlling group have a superior product as it is hands down more efficient in every dimension. Despite this, LIKE CENTRAL BANKS Bitcoin cash is controlled by a small group of elites and if in the future it was to become a prominent currency you would be practically replacing like for like.\n \nIn conclusion, the bitcoin experiment has failed because above all a core group always emerges hell bent on control.

The international wire system is a good example of that - $25 to send $10,000 isn't unreasonable, but when you try to do smaller transactions, $25 to send $10 is stupid. Thus, you need a second layer transaction system to handle smaller payments for a smaller fee (like $0.10) - think Visa or Interac. However, this means that there are multiple layers of fees and middle-men that make the system complicated, slow, and overall more expensive than if everyone could use one solution (say, Visa to send $10,000 overseas for $0.10).\n\nRight now Bitcoin is like the wire transfer system, with a fee that is based on supply and demand. Wit low demand, the fee was low, pennies per transaction. However, there is a cap on how many transactions can be confirmed every 10 minutes (however many fit in a 1MB block of transactions). As BTC got popular, the fee went up; we're well past $5 now to get your transaction sent. And the high cost is driving potential BTC users away to other coins.\n\nSegwit is complicated, but it basically boils down to stuffing more transactions into each block using a lot of math and complicated code. It works, but it's not a great solution and doesn't allow for many more transactions to go through which is the heart of the issue; IIRC it's about 1.7x as many as the original blocks in a best case scenario, and often a lot less.\n\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin Cash simply increases the block size to 8MB, so 8 times as many transactions fit in each block, increasing the supply and thus reducing the price of transactions. The only real drawback to that is the slightly increased bandwidth cost, which at some point will become a problem for the average internet connection.

As far as I can tell, segwit and ln are an effort to make Bitcoin vulnerable to theft and to centralize it.

It's an even better store, even, because you can move your wealth quickly if you need to.\n\nI don't disagree, but there are a few problems with BCH that make me perceive it as having a high risk/low reward.\n\nSure the market cap is high, but how artificially inflated is it? A lot of the existing BCH is either \"dead\" money (from forked wallets where the owner either does not know it exists or does not have access to the wallet anymore) or in exchanges that have yet to release the funds. Meaning these inactive coins have value. If there is a time to buy BCH at its least risky point, it's shortly after the exchanges dump/release these funds. You're GOING to have a liquidation of these funds. Why buy pre-liquidation?\n\nAs far as I'm concerned: the big boys know this. It's no mistake it got pumped to all fuck weeks/months before this happened.\n\nSecond is that its value was pegged to BTC. It was a \"fractional reserve\" of sorts. A short-term hedge against it replacing BTC. It's too hard to say if that's the case, but taking the 100% bet, selling all BTC, and buying all BCH is a ridiculously poor investment strategy. \n\nThe third problem is alternatives. The BCH proponents often say \"it's a better currency\" because it does x, y, and z better than BTC. OK. But it's not established. \"It's the real BTC\" is an assumption. A bet. A risk. And established coins that don't rely on that risk [like ETH and LTC] do about the same as BCH with a longer history of stability/opportunity for growth. If BCH was priced in the $10-20 range hell yeah it'd be a good opportunity. But it's at $1000/coin. There's not a huge opportunity for growth unless a relatively un-proven coin suddenly skyrockets. And even then you're not talking the initial 7000%+ opportunity that BTC once had. You're talking 10-20x. Hell even if it's more like 100-200x over a 10-20 year period that's way too low of a reward for such risk.  \n\n", 2], ["2017-11-17 00:08:45", "I think you just summed up the crypto-community pretty well.   \n \n>BCH is up 10%!

Flexible transactions are canonical. There is no doubt about that.\n\n\nAs you mentioned this last year, when I explained this as well, I know where your flaw in thinking comes from.  So I'll try to explain it again.\n\nThe normal flow of transaction creation is that a user creates a transaction, then signs it. What is important to realize that in cryptographic signing you sign a byte-array of data. Any byte is changed, reordered etc, and the signature will fail. As such, as in all crypto, **the canonical format of a transaction is the list of bytes that we include in a block**. When you realize this basic fact you see that deadalnix's idea makes no sense.\n\nLet me explain using less technical jargon;\n\nImagine you sign an email.  What deadalnix says is that you can't read it into MSWord and then write it out again because Word may change some details in the roundtrip. And thus that signed email would no longer validate. This is naturally true.  \nBut **the action of signing the email has as its sole purpose to make it provably read-only**. Anyone edits it, and the world will know.  So like Word refuses to write out a document that is marked read-only, any good bitcoin software will not try to overwrite an already signed transaction.\n\nSo what any software would do is check the signature and then after they realize the transaction is \"Okay\". Then you may read it in Word in read-only mode. But they would never ever write it out again.  Its signed, you can't change it anyway.\n\n\n**Tl;dr.**  A (partially) signed transaction is like a read-only document.

I was talking about the real-world consensus, regardless of whether it's embedded in code or facilitated by some other means. So I'll maintain my position that looser rules by itself doesn't really help with \"the consensus\".\n\n> This is not an attack vector\n\nAll distinct ways of attacking can surely be described as a vector?\n\n> that's just the question of having your block propagated fast enough or not\n\nNetwork propagation / network delay - and exploits related to it - is one attack vector for sure. But the validation speed (*after* all the necessary data has been received) is a separate issue, imho.\n\nFor example, the worst-case situation for the much-hyped \"quadratic scaling of signature hashing\" [[1](https://zander.github.io/posts/Quadratic%20Hashing/), [2](https://medium.com/the-publius-letters/segregated-witness-a-fork-too-far-87d6e57a4179)], needed for verifying signatures, is affected by block size and hardware, but has nothing to do with network propagation/delay by itself (at least until you start looking at the combined effects of both attack vectors, that is).\n\n> But I don't think that {a, b, c, d} are different in quality of agreed-upon consensus. It's just different rules, but it's all compatible with Bitcoin and the consensus system.\n\nThat seems like a strange sentiment and I'll have to think some more about it. You aren't saying that *all* rules are equal (as long as they're \"Bitcoin-compatible\"), are you? How do you judge \"consensus quality\"? What does \"compatible with Bitcoin and the consensus system\" mean?\n\n> EC is a bit different to the others imho (and I think it's overengineering..)\n\nWhat, why? What makes EC so different (even overengineered) than having no limit? As far as I know, EC doesn't include any activation procedures, but leaves that part for the miners to work out while 1) it removes the hard-coded blocksize limit from the consensus rules and 2) it includes a method and format for nodes to signal what they would accept.

Why would Gold need a digital version to become a standard metric for value?\n* How will this bitcoin become a world standard metric when it has so little ability for usage (and thus limited ability for individual understanding, limited ability for acquisition, or just limited ability to influence the lives of most individuals in the world)?\n* Why are we not comparing it to other, more precious metals?  Why did the world center on gold as opposed to Platinum?  Some of that answer should include recognition and availability. (read that as \"network capacity\")\n* Truly, it's a frequently used point, but Bitcoin is supposed to be \"P2P e-cash\".  Not \"world value basis\" or \"electronic gold\" or \"settlement layer\".  Please don't dismiss this off-hand.  What was the purpose of Bitcoin's creation?  A portion of it was to have a consistent basis for valuation, yes.  The other portion was not only for individuals to be able to run nodes (and participate in that valuation) but for value transfer between individuals.  Transactions!  And fast at that - otherwise why not have one block per day?  Or 1KB block limits?  Or why not create a crypto that has more \"Gold\" properties than Bitcoin?\n* Competition.  Any crypto that has Bitcoin's properties +1 will outdo Bitcoin and decrease its valuation (thus decreasing its value as \"Gold\")  As much as people might hate Bitcoin Cash, it had ~10% of Bitcoin's valuation on the day it was created.  Little name recognition (although it did include \"Bitcoin\"), little availability on exchanges, small group of developers, small use for Point of Sale.  Frankly, NOTHING going for it compared to Bitcoin but for the simple promise of future potential.

It's not the fact that it's digital or open-source or decentralized.\n\nIt is ALL of those characteristics that make Bitcoin what it is, what it can become, why people are interested in it, why it can change the world.\n\n*Yes, there are technical limitations to everything.

During the month of November, you will receive a 3% airdrop directly into your wallet. In December the airdrop will increase to 4% airdrop every Monday. In January the airdrop will increase to 5% every Monday. In February it will increase to 6% every Monday and it will continue increasing by 1% every month until all of the coins have been distributed.\n\nOne more thing, Bitcore will be a top 100 coin as soon as Coin Market Cap updates the correct numbers on their site.

You are telling them that they can do whatever the fuck they want and you as a sheep will fall in line out of fear for what might happen. Why would anyone willing to choose to support BCH after what they tried to do? You need to have big balls in the crypto space and that means hodling BTC when incidents like this past weekend come about. If you run to the exchange and buy BCH out of fear, then Roger Ver and his tactics have beaten you and made you submit. \n\n\nThe crypto space isn't kind to the weak-hearted and weak-minded. BTX is going to overtake BCH by the end of 2018. Be smart and pick up some BTX, while it's still cheap. You'll thank me for it later. But that is the difference between BTX and BCH. BCH tries to scare people into compliance. BTX only presents facts and then lets people make up their own minds. That's what the crypto space should be about.

If I was a bad guy, I could take that information and make your life miserable. \n\nBefore I buy a coin, I try to learn something about it. Considering that Roger Ver is now the most polarizing figure in the crypto space I would have expected that someone who invested in a Ver and Bitmain coin would know that basic fact about Roger Ver and how he is now known as Bitcoin Judas instead of Bitcoin Jesus.  \n\nAs for me taking pleasure in psychological warfare, you should learn to be kinder to strangers because there are all kinds of people on the internet. I didn't become an asshole until you told me to \"get the fuck out of here\". The philosophy of many martial arts it to take the enemies attack and aggression and use it against them. If you are an aggressor, I will find a way to use that aggression against you. Tai Chi, Sun Tzu, et al., all teach this. Just because you battle with someone using words doesn't mean that the same principles don't apply. If you are going to be an asshole, I will become your worst nightmare. Lesson to you is don't be rude to people that you don't know because that was only 10% of how malicious I can be, but that's besides the point.\n\nI glimpsed your post and you seem to be a nice guy. I would say that you're even a bit delusional. People are upset because Ver is trying to destroy Bitcoin, which has come to be known as the symbol of the crypto space, all so that he can supplant it with his own centralized coin, which he and his people can wield full power over. If he can control Bitcoin, he will control the entire cryptosphere. People aren't going to take that lying down. Posting a comment that we shouldn't be infighting in the crypto space isn't going to change what Roger Ver and his followers have tried to do to Bitcoin and will continue to do. That's delusional. \n\nVer would have to admit his mistakes, make a public apology and stop attacking Bitcoin. Were he to do those things, then the community would be able to heal and people would stop fighting amongst themselves and picking sides. This is all the doing of Roger Ver, who created the Bitcoin Cash that you bought. However, Ver will never do any of those things, so the battle between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin will continue, until people begin to look at Bitcore and realize that it's a better product than both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The difference is Bitcore will not try to use Roger's  techniques to take over the space.\n\nThat's pretty much the reason for my post. Everyone is talking about Bitcoin Cash as if it's something special. It really isn't and to make a plea to the community to stop fighting isn't going to make a difference. Roger Ver knows exactly what he's doing and he will do it again. So, don't expect the fighting to end anytime soon. If you want to end the fighting within the crypto space, contact Roger Ver and Bitmain and get them to cease and desist from all of their attacks on Bitcoin. That is the only way you will get peace and togetherness once again.\n\nThat's it for me here.

So, for every 50 payments I try to send, only one of them even has a chance of working. The rest don't even find the payee.\n\nHow small of a subset can you track before payments become unreliable? If I want to have reliable payments, I either need to see at least one channel for each of the 10 billion users (~1TB of data), or I need some kind of p2p search protocol that doesn't exist.\n\nOtherwise, to avoid melting my phone's CPU and burning all my bandwidth, I could trust some centralized hub to do the routing for me. If the network has a few thousand giant hubs with a few million users each, the routing logic gets a lot simpler. When my phone goes to make a payment, the hubs can talk among each other to find a route, and then tell me what to sign to make it happen. Each hub can just track all 100 billion channel states for completely reliable routing, which only costs a 5 gigabit connection. Compared to the money locked up in all these channels, the data center costs would be trivial.\n\nIf a Lightning hub is going to watch the world's transactions anyhow, what if we just put those transactions in a blockchain? With on-chain scaling, this level of activity would consume about 4TB blocks every 10 minutes. Running a full node capable of handling this traffic costs about $50K a year using today's technology - expensive, but well within the reach of exchanges, wallets, miners, and merchant processors [1]. Since this is the global payment network, there will be thousands of businesses making this investment, each with a few million users (just like the Lightning case).\n\nSo, whether you do Lightning or on-chain scaling, you end up in the exact same place. I think this would be true of *any* trustless payment system - the only way to avoid double-spends is to watch all the transactions, and once you have computers capable of doing that, it doesn't matter too much how you organize the data (blockchains, Lightning channels, Byzantine consensus, credit-card processors, PayPal, or whatever). The bandwidth and storage costs are roughly the same any way you slice it.\n\n[1] https://youtu.be/PKFkhWWiLDk", 4], ["2018-04-13 07:25:42", "Given that it's a randomized algorithm, are there published analyses of whether it's expected to converge on a solution, and how long it'll take as the network grows?

When both parties cooperate, the number of on-chain transactions is minimized, but both parties rely on being able to cash out, using the real blockchain, if the other party stops cooperating or goes offline for an extended period of time. In addition, if the other party acts maliciously, you rely on being able to use the blockchain to punish their malicious actions.\n\nOne security risk lies here: if you cannot get transactions confirmed into the blockchain, you won't be able to get your money out of the channel, or to take counter measures when the other party tries to cheat you! So a well-functioning blockchain (confirming transactions quickly) is a definitely one security assumption of using the lightning network. So block crowding is one risk, since there won't be enough room for your transactions. Miners could also be bribed to not mine your transactions, although this is not a severe risk since it is likely that a different miner would confirm your transaction.\n\nTo understand some of the other security assumptions used in the lightning network, consider the following example. Suppose Alice has a payment channel open with Bob. First the channel balances read:\n\nChannel Balance 1:\nAlice: 0.5 BTC\nBob:   0.5 BTC\n\nThen Alice makes a payment to Bob for 0.1 BTC, and the updated channel balances read:\n\nChannel Balance 2:\nAlice: 0.4 BTC\nBob:   0.6 BTC\n\nBut Alice decides she wants to try to cheat Bob! She tries to broadcast the transaction for Channel Balance 1, in which she gets 0.5 BTC, which is more favorable to her than her balance in Channel Balance 2, just 0.4 BTC. What's to stop her from doing this?\n\nFirst, there is a waiting period before she can actually spend the funds from her 0.5 BTC output in Channel Balance 1 (technically the wait period applies to Channel Balance 2 as well). This wait period exists to give Bob sufficient time to notice that Alice has closed out the channel, and possibly take action if Alice has broadcasted an old version of the channel. In this case, since Alice closed out the channel with an older version of the channel state, Bob can actually take all of the funds in Alice's 0.5 BTC output! Hence, Alice is disincentivized from broadcasting old versions of the channel state.\n\nThe problem is that if Bob can't get his transaction that took the 0.5 BTC from Alice into the blockchain, then the wait period will end and Alice will have the opportunity to take the 0.5 BTC, successfully stealing 0.1 BTC (because she should only be allowed to take 0.4). So Bob depends on being able to take counter measures against Alice in the real blockchain before a wait period ends if Alice tries to broadcast an older version of the channel state.\n\n(Note that this wait period also applies to Bob if he needs to get funds out of the channel without the help of Alice. Even if he broadcasts the most recent state of the channel, he has to wait. While this wait period may be inconvenient for Bob, Alice also has to abide by the wait period, which is what gives Bob a chance to take all of the funds in the channel if Alice tries to broadcast an old version of the channel. If things go as planned, though, and no one goes offline, then Alice and Bob can agree to make a new transaction to close the channel, where neither one has to wait to spend their funds.)\n\nThere is also a data security risk. Proving to the other channel party that you will not try to broadcast previous versions of the channel balance state involves giving the other channel party a bit of secret information, typically the preimage of a hash. Usually you only reveal this data to your channel counter-party when you update the state of the channel and receive a new guarantee of payment (just with a different balance). After you receive the new payment, you can reveal the secret information that invalidates the previous payment by giving them the ability to steal the funds from that old channel state if you try to broadcast it.\n\nBut if the secret data associated with the current state of the channel is revealed or stolen before you get a separate payment guarantee transaction, then effectively all of your transactions have been revoked and your channel counter-party can steal all the funds from any channel transaction you broadcast! So, the security of a LN payment channel depends on being able to keep data safe.\n\nAnother risk is simply bugs in software. If your software doesn't automatically handle all the edge cases of broadcasting the right transaction at the right time, and your counter party discovers that, they can take advantage of it and steal funds from the channel.\n\none of the biggest risks is that there could exist an issue with the two way pegging mechanism. Such a failure could introduce issues where perhaps coins are unable to be retrieved from the sidechain and returned to the bitcoin blockchain. There is also the risk of an unknown network attack on the lightning network, perhaps a ddos attack against validator nodes that would render transactions unable to be processed on the off chain network. There could be others as well.", 1], ["2018-04-13 09:34:47", "LN works through a mechanism known as Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC). These are used for direct-to-agent and cross channel (routed agent) transactions. The main feature of HTLC is that if the transaction cannot be or is chosen not to be completed, to terminate, the transaction is left to expire in the absence of the fulfillment of a requirement. However, this gives rise to a magnificent DDoS amplification attack across an entire LN, as we will see, even with astringent hop and rate limiting.\n\nThe simplest cross-channel payment works the following: Bob and Alice are in a LN channel, but Alice wants to make a payment to Carol. Alice sees on the blockchain that Carol is already in a LN channel with Bob, so Alice requests an HTLC with Bob, for Bob to transact with Carol. If Bob doesn't complete a transaction with Carol, he is unable to transact with Alice to be compensated accordingly. If Carol never completes the transaction, then that transaction simply expires upon time lock expiration, and Alice's does as well after time lock expiration, if she also never signs it.\n\nNow, imagine a mesh or spoke-hub LN topology with n agents. A malicious party, Alex, chooses or creates a receiving agent(s) in the LN, Carol, to maximize the number of agents (nodes) in the path to reach Carol (also with the malicious party). Alex tells the first agent, Bob, that there exists Carol. However, Carol is very far away, so Alex compensates Bob appropriately (yet cheaply as LN promises) to propagate the payment creating HTLCs along the way. However, when Carol sees the payment request, Carol does not know how to complete the last HTLC. Carol never asked for a payment or is aware of the secret required to complete the transaction. Agents (nodes) ask Alex to terminate the transaction. As Alex remains silent, agents wait patiently, transactions stop propagating because of Carol's HTLC, in hopes to at least be able to broadcast the newest state. However, because of the uncertainty of the HTLC (a true UXTO) made for Carol, no HTLC can be closed as she can spontaneously redeem it; where the only remedy is to close the channel and spending the UXTO before Carol. The waiting nodes isolate the unaffected nodes, paralyzing the entire network.\n\nThe solution at first may seem to be to limit the hops, as each hop increase affects an exponential amount of nodes involved in an attack, but that ensures centralization. Yet even with a single hop, one could easily imagine one node sending the attack to every node a hop away. The logical alleviation would be to rate limit, but then one forgets the reason of having a network only capable of interacting with a single node with a single transaction per hour.

They can't necessarily be eating grains and legumes all day long and expect to live healthy lives. It would be like feeding a vegetarian diet to a cat. Evil and unnatural.", 1], ["2018-03-13 00:27:42", "Except humans are primates which are vegetarians by evolution.  A chimpanzee killing an animal isn't for dietary requirements.\n\nAlso, your logic is that if an Orca brutally kills an animal, then its ok for you to do the same?  That seems like a pretty weak argument.  Even if you extended it out, like saying your ancestors ate meat, or murdered or raped, therefore its ok for you to do the same?\n\nIf humans were meant to eat meat, then they wouldn't get heart disease from doing so.  True animals that are adapted to eating meat will not get heart disease from it.", 0], ["2018-03-13 02:28:59", "Wow this is getting really off topic. Regardless:\n\nFirst, many primates are omnivores by evolution, and human beings clearly fall into that category.\n\nSome smaller primates eat insects almost exclusively. Most apes eat at least some insects, many eat eggs, and chimps' diets are often between 5% and 10% animal meat. \n\nIt would likely be even more, but sadly, they often don't eat most of the animal, because sometimes they are horribly violent for sport rather than nutrition. That makes it *worse* though, not better.\n\nSecond, that's just a straw man argument. That's not the logic at all.\n\nThe logic is that since humans are *less* brutal and more humane than other species, human hunting and farming can be considered *less bad* and less brutal than the kind of hunting and eating that occurs in nature in many cases.\n\nAnd, if we don't fault animals that are much more brutal than humans in the sickening ways in which they kill each other, why then would we fault humans for doing it much more humanely and with much greater sensitivity to needless suffering?\n\nThere is no perfect species, but clearly, humans are among the most humane, by a large degree. It's a gradient, and on that gradient, human meat eaters are some of the most humane animals on the planet.\n\nThere are also countless symbiotic domestic animals that co-evolved with humans over the millennia, and completely removing all animal consumption among humans would effectively sentence all of them to extinction. Is that moral?\n\nThird, humans don't get heart disease from eating meat though. Many of the longest lived peoples in the world eat some meat. \n\nNow, too much grain fed read meat, particularly *processed* meat has been linked to hear disease or earlier death, especially when coupled with lack of exercise or other risk factors. The same is true for processed grains and the like.\n\nBut in general, if you compare a person who eats a lot of processed grains and the like to someone who eats a lot of lean cuts of white meat and fish, and moderate amounts of fresh darker meats, the latter is likely to be much healthier, all else being equal.\n\nIn either case, yes, eating a lot of vegetation is also good for you. Human beings are indeed omnivorous after all, like a majority of mammal and animal species. But there are also native peoples, like the Inuits, who have very low incidence of heart disease coupled with a traditional diet that is very low in vegetable consumption and high in meat consumption.\n\nAnyway: You do you. Eat what you are comfortable with, ethically and morally. I will do the same.", 1]]}, "60": {"created": "2018-01-03 12:16:02", "title": "Gavin Andresen Drops A New Concept On Github for Bitcoin Cash - Bitcoin News", "num_comments": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "score": 116, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2018-01-03 20:39:52", "Oh I do indeed enjoy Gavin.\n\nOnly truly watched a few panel discussions with him however he has my ear the whole way through.\n\nKeep up the positive developments.\n\nThanks", 18], ["2018-01-03 22:14:25", "Can some explain simple way so average Joe can understand how his proposed update/concept could help the network?", 9], ["2018-01-03 21:22:24", "Brilliant glad he is working on solving issues and not telling us to deal with high fees etc.  ", 9], ["2018-01-04 16:40:08", "Thank you Gavin (/u/gavinandresen)!\n\nThis is a great idea and it's so good to see you back doing what you're good at and helping Bitcoin.\n\nThe UTXO is the critical resource (regarding **storage**) for a fully verifying node and I love how you point to *one way* of storing it a bit more efficiently so we can ease the fear of large blocks.\n\nThis idea also reduces **bandwidth** demand for a node greatly, especially on bootstrapping.\n\nThose kind of ideas (also the weak blocks / subchains one and the many ideas about optimizing block propagation) really go to show that the bottlenecks showing when doing on-chain scaling really are \"engineering problems\" that *can* (and *will*) be solved when they show up.

It takes the same amount of time for data to go through each funnel, assuming there is no congestion.  \n1. If data enters the funnel faster than it can be released (exceeding throughput) then it begins to queue (back up).  \n  \nThis is the same mechanism that explains why you can download a file at 100Mb/sec but you may still ping the server you're downloading it from at 500ms.  The 100Mb/sec is the throughput, but the 500ms is the latency.  That pipe might be backed up, but you still have data in it.  So while you can get data at a certain rate, it may not be real-time due to the latency.  \n  \nOn point #4, this is why it can take a long time to confirm transactions in Bitcoin (or any coin really).

As Bitcoin is open source the community with vested interests are the ones who decide the future of the project. \n\nBitcoin came up with two potential scalability solutions.\n\nOption A: To  increase block size from 1mb to 8mb , thus allowing transactions to be confirmed faster and keeping fees low. This was a simple solution and although more like a band-aid to the overall problem of scalability it arguably does the job for the time being. This option would have been consistent with the original Bitcoin whitepaper. \n\nOption B : Segwit, removing signatures from the 1mb blocks to allow more transactions into this block, thus allowing more transactions to be confirmed quicker. This was not consistent with the original Bitcoin whitepaper and in theory decreases security. There was also the idea of using side chains which in reality are basically using IOU ( i owe you ) tokens which would then be credit to the user after processing of a transaction. Also very controversial as it would be giving power and control to the companies responsible for these side chains ( block stream). Segwit2x was basically the same idea but doubling the block size from the current 1mb. \n\nThe problem was then to decide the next step. Part of the Bitcoin community which aligned with option A forked Bitcoin. \nBecause this fork happened prior to a 51% decision taking place this fork had to name their project, the name chosen was Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBitcoin remained the same and thus kept the name of Bitcoin. Segwit2x  did not go ahead and technically speaking Bitcoin is the \"REAL\" Bitcoin as no changes have really happened and the majority was still behind it. \n\nIn generic terms both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are actually BITCOIN. \n\nIf Bitcoin goes ahead with sidechains and Segwit2x, in theory this would not be the\n \"REAL\" Bitcoin as the vision of the project would have drastically changed from the original project.  In that case Bitcoin Cash would technically be the original Bitcoin but it can't ever claim the name Bitcoin because it forked without a majority vote.\n\nThe problem here is that Bitcoin is not a company, it is not run by any specific entity. It is intended to be used as a means of exchange, a digital deflationary substitute for CASH.  \n\nBitcoin Cash is not going to be the real Bitcoin in branding because it forked without a majority vote, but it technically is in its core. \n\nWhat is better?

The solution is right here.\n\nAlso BCH does not have an average block size of 40KB, I'm not sure where you pulled that from? I see something else:\nhttps://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin%20cash-size.html\n\nRegarding this artificial 1MB limit imposed by Blockstream / Bitcore fans... Satoshi literally wrote inline code notes on the block size limit and expected it to be raised / removed one day. Satoshi himself said nof the blocksize limit:\n\u201cWe can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it.\u201d It was not meant to EVER be a permanent 1MB limit. Read up.\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/satoshis-best-kept-secret-why-is-there-a-1-mb-limit-to-bitcoin-block-size\n\nMoore's law and history has shown that technology and hardware keep getting cheaper to make and more powerful. Harddrive space and bandwidth are much greater today than they were in 2008. A 1MB limit then is totally unnecessary now with major HD/SSD/Bandwidth advances. We could increase the block size drastically and it wouldn't be THAT much more expensive to run a node. If you're really concerned with people being able to run a node on a Rasberry Pi, then I just don't really feel bad. I don't think the vision of Bitcoin was for EVERY SINGLE BITCOIN USER TO RUN A NODE. That's not the point.\n\nThe fact that you and many others keep repeating \"well we need better longer term solutions\" seems to point to the effectiveness of the /r/bitcoin propaganda machine. It's been running full blast for years now. The solution IS HERE ALREADY. It was HERE for many years. The thing that changed is a small group, Blockstream, gained massive influence over a majority of decisions being made on behalf of the open source project. It's essentially a hi-jacking and we're all along for the ride.\n\nIf LN does end up working, it will centralize things. Even though Bitcoin Core supporters apparently care about centralization.\n\nBig Block Scaling + a busy network like BTC = no bottlenecks, better utility and happier end-users. A massive majority of Bitcoin users don't run nodes themselves anyways so why is it such a concern? Also keeping in mind 1MB in 2008 is like 10MB now in terms of cost to make.\n\nI appreciate the dialogue but I just don't see eye-to-eye with BTC maximalists. And the constant trolling (not you) in the Bitcoin Cash thread and the constant censorship in the /r/bitcoin thread is ridiculous.\n\nWe'll see how LN \"works\" in 6-7 weeks.

You're here talking about brand hijacking as if the team of people who are doing the MOST amount of change to Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core) are the people who somehow own the brand? Where do BTC maximalists get off thinking that they are the true Bitcoin brand? If anything, Bitcoin should be renamed to Bitcoin Lightning or Bitcoin Segwit or whatever, because it is now SO much different than original Bitcoin and it's original intent that it's no longer Bitcoin.

Put a remind me on that.\n\nThis division you're talking about came about because of greedy developers employed by a greedy corporate entitiy, Blockstream. Roger Ver has done more for Bitcoin than a majority of people on the planet. Why would he sacrifice his BTC holdings for BCH? Wouldn't it just be much easier to keep the BTC train going and make mass profits? WHY would Roger Ver purposely create BCH and divest his BTC? Is he just planning some massive elaborate pump 'n dump scheme? Really? BTC maximalist arguments always come down to Roger Ver and Jihan Wu propaganda, fear mongering, blah blah blah.\n\nFact is people ARE NOT DUMB. Nobody is going to pay these insane $10-$20 fees for sending $5. Original Bitcoin (did you ever use it?) acted exactly how Bitcoin Cash does, and the people who had the most to gain (BTC holders) had every incentive to keep BTC flowing smoothly. \n\nGuess who does not have large BTC holdings? Blockstream. Now what do you think a for-profit company would do in order to make money to pay back their investors if they don't have large BTC holdings like original BTC developers and pioneers like Roger Ver? The answer is they are going to make a profit by creating fees which are embedded in Lightning Network. These fees siphon profits away from miners and into a single corporate company's pockets.

It's truly laughable at this point.\n\nBTC maximalists should asks themselves, WHO has the most to gain by creating a 2nd layer settlement solution on top of Bitcoin that takes fees away from miners and puts them into the pockets of a single corporate entity? Hmmm, are the miners benefitting from this? No. Are the customers benefitting from this? No, BCH already solves this problem (not theoretically either, ACTUALLY). There's only one other group of people who will benefit from Lightning Network, and that's Blockstream. They aren't here for charity and they aren't here to make the world a magically better place with their 2nd / 3rd layer solutions and arbitrarily defined block size limits.\n\nIf BTC maximalists were TRULY CONCERNED about division and brand hijacking THEY WOULDN'T BE PARTICIPATING IN /r/bitcoin, a PROVABLY festering wound of censorship.

Any transaction that pays the min fee should be included in the next block, no matter how many transactions there are.  There is no justification for limiting the size of blocks, and obvious reasons why one should NOT do that.  \n\nTherefore, a correct implementation of the protocol should be able to stuff into the next block any amount of transactions that could possibly come up in normal operation, and handle any block that another honest miner could possibly create. \n\nHOWEVER, as anyone who has experience in writing reliable software knows, any actual implementation will have a block size limit.  If not explicit, there will be an implicit limit, set by some external library, by the operating system, by the internet interface, or just by the available RAM.  \n\nIf different implementations have different limits, a malicious miner can force the coin to split permanently by mining just one block of the right (that is, wrong) size, that is too big for some miners but okay for the rest.  If the first group had a minority of the hashpower, they would start their own branch that excludes that big block; whereas the majority would ignore that branch and mine their own branch, including that block.\n\nIn order to prevent that attack, one must ensure that all implementations have the same block size limit.  \n\nAlthough Satoshi never explained why he put the 1 MB limit, sometime in 2010, that is the only conceivable reason.  His original Jan/2009 implementation had a 32 MB limit; but it was set accidentally by some lower-level messaging library.  If someone wrote another implementation, or just compiled that same code on another platform, the limit could be different -- and then the system would be vulnerable to a big-block attack.  By putting the 1 MB limit into the validity rules, he ensured that all correct implementations would agree on the meaning of \"too big\".]\n\nIt is vital to understand that **the block size limit is not meant to limit the size of blocks!**  This may sound nonsense, but think of a guardrail by the side of a road.  The rail is not meant to constrain traffic, not even in the busiest times.  If cars are hitting the guard rail, the rail is badly placed and should have been placed further away.  Likewise, if a block actually hits the size limit, it means that the limit is way too low, and should have been set much higher.\n\nIn fact, the block size limit M must be as high as possible, in order to discourage DoS attacks by spamming.  To disrupt the system, a spammer needs only issue enough transactions in a short time to completely fill the next few blocks to the limit.  The higher M is, the more expensive such attack would be, and hence less likely to happen.\n\nSince the block size limit does not limit the size of blocks, its value is not important -- as long as it is much higher than a block can possibly be, and yet any miner *could* handle a block that big without choking.  \n\nSatoshi chose the nice round limit of 1 MB, which was more than 100 times the size of the largest block seen until then.  Today, the limit should be 200 MB or more.  Obviously, it would not mean that blocks *would* be 200 MB; on the contrary, it would mean that the developers are practically certain that no block would get anywhere close to that size, not even in extreme surges of traffic.  \n\nGiven that premise, it should be clear that a dynamic block size limit -- a formula M(n) that  varies depending on block number n -- makes no sense.  First, since the precise value of the limit is not important, it would be impossible to justify such a formula.  More importantly, as said above, every implementation of a dynamic size limit would  be unable to increase the limit M(n) above a certain \"size limit limit\" MM.  However, if MM is not defined explicitly in the validity rules, then each implementation  the coin could have a different MM, and the coin could again be split if someone mined a block of a certain magic size -- the very vulnerability that the size limit was meant to prevent.\n\nHowever, if the \"size limit limit\" MM is explicit and part of the block validity rules, then every developer must make sure that his implementation can handle any block size up to MM.  \n\nBut then, **there is no justification for setting the size limit M(n) to anything less than MM.** \n\nTry to imagine a road that has a dynamically variable number N(d) of lanes, which is adjusted in the morning of each day d with the goal of ensuring that there is practically no risk that traffic will be congested later in the day.  Obviously there would be a maximum number NN of lanes, beyond which N(d) cannot be increased.  But then having a variable number of lanes is just stupid:  letting all NN lanes open every day (that is, setting N(d) constant at NN) would be, not just simpler, but much cheaper.\n\nIn 2013, Greg make a big fuss with his idea that the block size limit should be a real constraint on the capacity of the system, because of reasons.   Unfortunately he got millions of financing that enabled him to effectively take control of the github repository, kick out all dissenting developers, and impose his two-layer redesign on all bitcoiners.  But his worst \"contribution\" was convincing everybody, even the big-blockians who did not believe in his redesign, that the block size limit was an important parameter of the system that could not be allowed to become \"too big\".  \n\nThat misunderstanding was the parent of the various \"dynamic size limit\" proposals, like Jeff Garzik's BIP100.  Needless to say, the BIP100 text did not include a shred of justification.  And it could not have, because it was amazingly bad.  For one thing, it let the miners vote to reduce the size limit, which made no sense at all.  Jeff's formula would only increase the limit by 5% every 2 weeks, and only if a supermajority of the miners agreed; which could easily drive the system into congestion in case of a traffic surge.  \n\nBut, more fundamentally, Jeff failed to understand the role of the size limit, the need for an explicit \"size limit limit\", and why a dynamic limit then made no sense.\n\nBy the way: Mike Hearn's BitcoinXT project adopted BIP100, however the official implementation happened to have a \"size limit limit\" MM of 32 MB -- apparently, without its developers being aware of it.  Then another implementation of Bitcoin XT could have inadvertently chosen a 16 MB or 64 MB \"size limit limit\".  Then, eventually the two implementations would disagree about the size limit M(n).  Then the only reason for the existence of a block size limit would be frustrated...\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash project currently has a very serious problem: the three \"official\" implementations cannot agree on the block size limit.   Officially it is 8 MB; however, the  \"XT\" implementation still uses BIP100, so that miners who use it could start mining and accepting bigger blocks at any moment.  The \"Unlimited\" implementation defines the size limit by the \"Emergent Consensus\" (EC) mechanism, that lets miners change the size limit in a different way, just by mining enough large blocks.  (By the way, I am not convinced yet that EC is safe.)  I am not sure how the \"ABC\" implementation defines the size limit, but apparently it is different from the other two.\n\nIncompatible block size limit is a huge and stupid bug.  Again, Satoshi put the explicit 1 MB limit in the validity rules precisely to avoid this situation.  The three dev teams must urgently agree on a common size limit.  As explained above, a dynamic limit makes no sense; and the precise value of of the limit is not important, as long as it is **much** larger than the largest block sizes that might normally occur, even during traffic surges.  \n\nThe suppressed demand for Bitcoin Core must now be 2 MB per block or more.

Obviously I agree with points 1 and 2.  \n\nAs for point 4, the \"Satoshi method\" for adjusting the block size requires that the new limit be added to the code many months before it is activated.  That is plenty of time for miners to adapt (basically by buying more RAM).\n\nMoreover, while a miner should ideally be prepared to handle any block up to size M(n), to exclude the risk of being knocked out by an extra-large block, capacity planning will mostly consider the **actual** block sizes T(n); which are supposed to be much smaller than the limit.  Both T(n) and its increase in the near future are unrelated to the size limit M(n) any planned increase of it. \n\nAs for the risk of DoS by \"invalid spam\": I cannot quite see how that would work.\n\nIf the attacker pretends to be a bunch of clients and simply throws a deluge of invalid transactions at the pools, that could indeed overload them, and slow down the processing of legitimate transactions.  However that risk is independent of the limit M(n), and exists now for any cryptocurrency.\n\nSo I suppose that your scenario is a malicious miner sending to the other pools a huge block that takes too long to validate, but is ultimately found to be invalid.  \n\nA legit pool can check the PoW puzzle just by looking at the block header.  So we may assume that the malicious miner actually solved the PoW puzze for the poison block.   \n\nAssuming that a transaction of size X can be validated in time O(X), every legit pool should be able to validate a block, of any size, in time proportional to the time that it took him to download the block.  That includes validating the hashes in the Mekle tree.\n\nIf the transactions in the poison block were broadcast in advance by the malicious miner, the legit pools would have already validated their signatures, as they were received.  If any of them were invalid, they would be discarded at that time.  Any valid transactions broadcast in advance could be mined by legit pools before the poison block gets propagated; then the malicious miner would lose their tx fees.  Like a spam attack, this sort of \"big block\" attack would be the more expensive the larger the limit M(n) is.\n\nSo I suppose you are assuming that the transactions in the poison block will not be broadcast  in advance.  Then the block will propagate slowly because its contents would have to be transmitted to each pool together with the header.  Then the legit pools would have time to validate each of its transactions, as it is received. \n\nIn other words, the bottleneck of the system (apart from PoW puzzle solving) is the downloading of the blocks, not their validation -- whether the signatures are validated before the block is sent, or while it is sent.\n\nTherefore, the only effect of a \"big invalid block\" attack would be to use up some of the bandwidth of the pools.  If a pool has a 1 Gb/s connection to the internet, downloading a 100 MB block would use up that connection for less than 1 second.  Since the attacker must actually solve the PoW puzzle for the poison block, he cannot repeat the attack more than once every 20 minutes, even if he had 50% of the total hashpower.\n\nI hope that Bitcoin Cash has retained the 1 MB limit on the size of a single transaction.  In fact, it would be advisable at the next hard fork to lower that limit to 100 kB or less, to reduce the risk and impact of possible \"slow validation\" attacks.  Unlike the block size limit, a transaction size limit does not constrain the capacity of the network, will be irrelevant to the vast majority of BCH users, and causes only mild inconvenience for those rare users who could use transactions with 10k inputs, 10k outputs, or 10k signatures on one input.\n", 1], ["2018-03-23 00:21:23", "> Without a block size, or with a very high block size, an attacker can use any valid header and produce an endless stream of transaction that it pretends are the content of the block in order to have a victim to an arbitrary large amount of computation before figuring out that the content of the block is not valid.\n\nWould it make sense to include one transaction proof in the new block announcement message? It'd consist of a list of merkle branches and one non-coinbase transaction (hash and serialized), preferably an \"old\" one with a sufficient fee per bytes. The receiving node could promptly validate this tx (cached or not) and check whether it creates the supposed merkle root. This prevents an attacker from using an orphaned block header, as any transaction proof would fail because of spent inputs. It would be easier to simply mine an honest block than to falsify one of these proofs.\n\nThis doesn't guarantee the block will be valid, but possibly closes an attack vector. After this initial validation, a miner can start working on an initially empty block while the correct state of the mempool is uncertain. Also, if the given proof transaction pays a really low fee so it might have been included in an orphaned block and at the same time not be confirmed yet, a miner can decide to just wait for full block validation.

Would you at least agree to this point? \n\nAnd **every miner must be prepared to handle a block of size M(n)**, otherwise he will be forced to stop mining if someone else solves a block of size M(n). \n\nEach miner m can also have a \"soft limit\" S(m,n) that is the max size of candidate blocks that **he** will try to mine.

That is, it's not so much that events just happened because there were causes and they fell like dominoes, rather it's that because people could see which way something was headed they took evasive action long before terrible consequences get to them. So things can often be explained by how impossible the other possibility is. Even things that seem strange on their surface can often be explained very simply in terms of how people can't tolerate moving towards the alternative. \n\nIn this case, BCH getting to price parity with BTC means catastrophe for BTC, which in its weakened state could actually mean chain death. That doesn't mean we're just wandering randomly towards BTC chain death, it means that a lot of powerful rich people have a huge motive to not let things go in that direction. \n\nSince they can't allow price parity (because it would then switch to the other side and BTC is on a difficulty adjustment algorithm that would be unable to handle its first time in that submissive position), that means they can't allow *near* price parity. If BTC is just worth *slightly* more than BCH, that's a terrible omen and everyone will see the imminent cashening and switch as quickly as they can get BTC to disgorge their coins. So they can't let it get to parity, which means they can't let it get *near* parity, which means they can't let it even get *near* near parity..... which means we can all feel the danger even from the remove of 5:1 and BTC hodlers are rightfully terrified.

So those numbers are very attractive to newcomers or people with just passing interest and no intention of being ideologues either way. The \"likes\" economy of social media has conditioned us to better trust content that receives greater amounts of likes/upvotes etc. So for better or worse, r/Bitcoin seems like the real deal just based on that.

But I think the rebuttal from BTC would be this is putting the cart before the horse. Sure, unbanked people *could* find utility in cypto payments, remittances etc, but in reality they aren't, because of a lack of merchants. BTC seems to want to build up the tech first, then let adoption happen organically, without selling it prematurely. \n\nThe \"unbanked\" argument is definitely compelling, but I don't agree BTC neglects it on principle, only effectively by not focusing on adoption.

BCH simply continues that exact same solution that was suggested in the beginning of Bitcoin. \n\nOutside of scaling - yes absolutely, more merchant adoption is needed, price volatility needs to be addressed, better wallet UIs etc.. But these can and I believe are already happening with BCH. For example I believe an SMS-only wallet is already in development for use with BCH, so something like the MPESA in Kenya can be done using BCH. \n\nI also think the pain point is so strong that if/when those who need it most start using it, see it\u2019s  potential and then see what else needs improving, things will get built incredibly quickly. \n\nOf course in the end time will tell.

Unfortunately I have no crystal ball, but only a chart, and can only draw conclusions from my own chart analyses. What I \"find out\", I try to share here on reddit (see above). However, I am skeptic about BTC prevailing against BCH. I - as opposed to a lot of people - doubt (for now) that Roger Ver is trying to scam people. And if he is behind BCH as he was with BTC then he will give everything to make it Bitcoin#1. I can imagine that he is lobbying a lot and tries to approach a lot of hedge funds and high net worth investors to trust BCH.\nFrom what I understand increasing the block size to 8MB was the better decision, especially when you look at the options left to BTC. BUT I am not an expert in IT/Computer Science and have only very limited knowledge on this topic compared to experts. So I will pass on trying to give an opinion on this.\nI would not mention any specific time frame when BCH would reach the $10,000 mark, but when looking at BCH's potential compared to BTC's, it would not surprise me if investors, such as Michael Novgratz, would switch from saying that BTC might reach $40,000 at the end of 2018 to saying that BCH might be above $10,000 at the end of 2018. He also said that he can hear the \"herd\" coming, talking of the mainstream institutional investors which according to him are \"about six to eight months from adopting BTC\". Could be that he is unconscously talking of BCH.\nIf you combine BCH's technological advantage with Novogratz's statement - replace BTC by BCH - and with Coinbase's CEO Adam White's statement that \"most (Coinbase) customers tend to be retail (...) however, the trading volume itself is primarily driven by institutional-level customers\", then you can guess what it could mean for BCH. However, from my chart observations so far, I can ascertain that BCH is overall growing much slower than BTC. I also think that BTC longevity depends on how long new altcoins and tokens are dependent on BTC to be \"funded\"/bought/acquired. I gave a longer answer on this in one of the previous comments.\nLong story short, I think that BCH has good prospects for 2018. Higher liquidity, more independent form BTC, technological innovation - the latter is missing in BTC. Who would invest in a company that cannot innovate? Only fools. However, from my chart observations so far, I can see that BCH is growing slower than BTC. Therefore, I don't expect an overall increase as big as BTC's. (Especially because BCH is not used, like BTC, to buy other cryptos.)\"\n", 2], ["2017-12-04 22:37:18", "You are welcome!", 2], ["2017-12-05 04:22:46", "Thanks. Let's hope all the best.

These are cryptos you can actually buy something in the real world with. \n\nTo be fair personally I haven't seen Monero used, but you get the idea. BTC might be gold where the rest are currencies - the point is they are in no way in the same league as TRON or QTUM or some bullshit coin that does nothing but make promises without a real product. \n\nNext, if you have spent any time in Japan it is clear how undervalued Bitcoin Cash is. I mean in Silicon Valley you might be lucky to find a few coffee shops that accept Bitcoin, but next to nobody using it as a currency or to buy things with. But with Bitcoin Cash, it was clear to me that everyone - and I mean everyone is using it almost daily. \n\nSo all I have to say is this. Adoption for Bitcoin Cash is currently in its baby stages. It will hop out of Japan in 2018 and start being used more and more in other parts of Asia as well as Europe. The point is that you will see massive rollouts of infrastructure for more and more businesses to take Bitcoin Cash all over the world. This isn't just some fad - and while there might be faster currencies or cheaper currencies along the way - that doesn't matter. \n\nPeople simply do not appreciate the immense lead that Bitcoin Cash has in the mind of the consumer as a daily-use cryptocurrency. \n\nBitcoin currently has 10X the value of Bitcoin Cash. I think Bitcoin should stay at the top of the heap for stability of the market, but there is no reason ETH should be 2X the value of Bitcoin Cash or that Bitcoin is 10X Bitcoin Cash - at the very least Bitcoin Cash should easily double moving forward, especially after listing on Coinbase. Also, moving forward Bitcoin can be 5X bigger than Bitcoin Cash and still preserve a fair value for the market. So I think the 2018 value of Bitcoin Cash should fall between $4000 - $8000 range and with Bitcoin sure to push into the $25K -> $30K territory in 2018 you can expect Bitcoin Cash to be able to keep up and follow around $6000 - $10,000. \n\n\nOf course at some point there will need to be a market correction.

To mitigate this, allow market to increase transaction fees such that the fees to use the system naturally equalize.  \n  \n*Reference: [LukeJr on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/944307220086390784)*  \n  \n**Phase 3 - Layer 2, The Lightning Network**  \n  \nDevelop a layer 2 lightning network solution which allows offloading of transactions to a secondary network that can later be settled on the main Bitcoin blockchain developed during Phase 1.  \n  \nThis solution is designed to mitigate the congestion and transaction fee issues from Phase 2.\n  \n**Phase 4 - LN User Adoption**  \n  \nUsers will begin to run lightning network nodes. Users will open channels with other users, or with merchants, and begin making transactions.  They may soon discover the points which the OP video has described.  \n  \n**Phase 5 - Generation 1 Services**\n\nDue to the issues in Phase 4, users may not want to run and operation LN nodes on their own.  They may find it tedious or not economically viable to maintain multiple channels to their peers.\n  \nHubs will naturally emerge and LN nodes will consolidate into these entities.  These hub operators will have enough capital, in both Bitcoin and fiat, to build out services designed to offload handing multiple channels for users.  Instead, users would open a single channel to these hubs, which themselves maintain the multi-channels to various other entities.  \n  \n*Reference: [What is the Lightning Network - bitTHINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k14EDcB-DcE)*  \n  \nA new problem may arise here in that users will need to pay some sort of fee to the hub provider for the size of channel they want to open.\n  \n*Reference: [/u/Chris_Pacia discussing OpenBazaar challenges with LN](https://np.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/7q65y3/will_ob_implement_lighting_network_features/dstii7r/)*  \n  \n**Phase 6 - Generation 2 Services**\n  \nUsers may wonder why they need to maintain a Bitcoin wallet if all of their transactions go through a hub. Large scale user adoption may be hindered by this unnecessary complexity.  The burden on the user to manage both layer 1 and layer 2 themselves may make users frustrated or confused.\n  \nNew services will emerge that will offer to alleviate the user from managing layer 1 wallets, similar to the exchanges of today.  These services will both hold and secure the users Bitcoin, and also have sufficient presence on the lightning network.  These services will allow for fast and convenient transactions by maintaining a series of large liquidity channels to other Generation 1 and Generation 2 service providers, and not require the user to open a channel to this provider since the provider holds their bitcoin for them.  \n  \nOccasionally these services would close and reopen their channels to settle on the layer 1 blockchain, but the fees paid and the time for the transaction to confirm would be irrelevant to the user as the user no longer interfaces directly with layer 1. The fees could be exceptionally high, perhaps in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the services would be able to afford that through channel liquidity fees and transaction fees collected from the users.  Services could delay settlement on channels to mitigate times where layer 1 fees are exceptionally high.\n\n**Phase 7 - Merchant Adoption**  \n  \nAt this point it is easy for the user to maintain their balance in a Gen2 service.  They are also able to send and receive to other users who have Gen1 and Gen2 services, but merchant adoption at brick-and-mortar stores may not exist yet.  There will need to be some sort of integration with existing services, such as credit card readers or Apple Pay-like devices, to allow seamless adoption.  This would allow users to buy groceries without the merchant being required to upgrade their existing infrastructure in any significant way.  \n  \n  \nIf we make it to **Phase 7**, it looks like all of the issues brought up in the OP would be solved for the user.  \n  \nedit: Added an additional reference link", 3], ["2018-02-03 20:57:18", "Will bitcoin cash go up than the bitcoin ", 2], ["2018-02-04 11:17:41", "It is just a temp bandage. if we get more crypto adoption and it needs to process 3mil transactions a day, then it would sit with the same problem as bitcoin has right now. \nWe do need some form of a multilayer scaling model imo. because that will scale exponentially.

Now, securities trading is just like any other transaction, so lets consider transactions in general? I think a good criteria for fraud in any transaction is thus: don't outright lie and don't omit anything that would cause a reasonable person to strongly believe in some falsehood. You don't necessarily have to disclose every single detail if there is no reason for the other to reasonably believe to the contrary, unless of course there is some reasonable expectation that you are in fact obligated to disclose everything. If they ask specifics you can't lie however.\n\nNow, turning attention to the securities market, for people running a public company there is a reasonable expectation (fiduciary duty) by current and prospective shareholders (the general public) that they will disclose everything relevant to a transaction before making it. Thus any market activity by them without full disclosure should be fraud and is. Now, if one in charge of a privately owned company gains some market knowledge in the course of business and uses that to influence their trades of other companies I don't see any problem there. There is no reason for them to be mandated to disclose their knowledge prior to their transactions as nothing is implied otherwise and there is no duty by them to disclose to anyone in particular.\n\nHowever, under current law the latter would still be illegal. If a private company shorts a competitor before they unveil a major innovation or buy stock of a partner before announcing a business deal, that would be considered insider trading. That's ludicrous, anywhere else similar things are accepted, as in real estate. For example, when buying land you don't need to disclose your potential use of it, whether it be oil drilling or building an expensive structure, even if that would make it more valuable pre-sale. Similarly if one buys stock from someone else they shouldn't have to disclose that they have a major deal in the works with them.", 1], ["2017-12-21 12:49:40", "Correct.

According to the criminal justice act of 1993 (UK law) insiders are considered the members of the board, any connected person to them (siblings, aunts etc) and any employee who possesses price sensitive information.

Ignoring the fact that you use NTS incorrectly, \n\n> You're against grassroots efforts in spreading awareness of cryptocurrency because it's \"too early\" and dismiss early adopters as \"novelty users\"\n\nis a misreading. Nowhere did i imply i am against spreading awareness. What I said is that without a cryptoeconomy, purchases using cryptocurrency are a novelty. If purchases are made with the intention of spreading awareness, that is simply another example of the absence of economy. The purchase was not \"in kind\" like a generic fiat purchase, meaning you buy both the good or service *and* the participation in the cause, which is its own form of currency (social currency) which you can use to advertise. There is no existing codependent network of merchants that trade internally in crypto exclusively, there are only fiat economies currently.\n\nSo while \"novelty\" isn't the most gracious term, it holds. Notice all the posts here about merchant adoption or selling your sportscar for BCH on craigslist. These remain individuated cases, the network that connects them is the internet, not an economy. And there is a social component carrying across all of it that gives them additional value, derived from its newness and alternate-ness. Novelty by definition. So yes, we are not there yet. No cryptocurrency is a true currency yet because purchases largely cannot be made in kind.\n\nThis is where BTC and BCH diverge. BCH opts to service the budding grassroots effort to grow the cryptoeconomy by facilitating transactions, starting in a low volume environment and working up from there. BTC takes an obverse approach, building up a solid value structure that can serve as a platform for further development. BTC devs understand that there is no need and little demand for cryptocurrency payments at the present moment, so they focus on the store of value element first. Then once the foundation is laid and the userbase is primed, the currency aspect will emerge. Thats why BTC devs have said they will consider increasing blocksize only after second layers have been developed, the so called need for Bitcoin to be a casual-use currency *today* is a red herring and ass-backwards.

So basically core has the notion that if you don't put at least $60 in, you're garbage and will have your BTC stolen in fees. Even if you have $60 or over you still pay around $30 for fees \n\nI suggest you look up the support topics right now for exchanges, I saw one yesterday where someone made a $1 test transaction out of his $40 balance and he ended up with $9 remaining. It ate him in fees. It's this type of misinformation we want to avoid but people are buying because they think it's a working get rich quick scheme and possibly they join r/bitcoin and get duped into thinking we are assholes who just want to steal their name, one of the few main arguments by core against us. When in reality, what is so wrong with having digital gold you can transfer for low fees and use as a currency? Nothing. They stick to the notion it's a store of value.\n\nSo if you invest in BTC right now (outside of an exchange where newcomers almost certainly aren't trading) you need to spend at least $31 to have $1 in BTC. Assuming you sell then that $1 need to cover the trans fee again. So you'd need to be up 300% to cover the fees. This is why it's a Ponzi scheme.\n\nWhat's so wrong with a digital store of value that you can ACTUALLY spend? Why does it have to be value over utility? Why not use both? Well core is telling you it's only a store of value or digital gold. If it's digital it should be spendable without requiring $30 in fees. They are building up an idea that just because it's a store of value, it can't be spendable. They are basically trying to convince you to BUY with hopes of getting rich and to not worry about the fees, but in reality people are losing so much money not realizing the fee market, not realizing they need to gain 300% to actually be in profits for their $60 transaction($30 in BTC after fees). All the while they still haven't received their coins and when they sell they will have a similar problem, and lost another $30 on top of that.\n\nWhy not cover the Reddit too, look at the censorship of main mod Theymos. After everything he deletes and how \"perfect\" their Reddit looks void of criticizism, he publicly states to not panic if the price corrects down to $5k. Because he knows it will. At this point however it will be too late because all BTC had over BCH right noe is profitability because of the fake 300%-400% increase. When that runs out and the price drops, ask yourself why anyone would ever need to go back to core?\n\nCore is telling you this is a ponzi and everything is ok and to just trust them.

And they won't get full, that is the whole point of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nIt is of course up to the miners which transactions to include. I'll try to explain my thought process:\n\nIf we imagine the distant future, when Bitcoin Cash has reached global mainstream adoption, and when all block reward coins are already mined, the only profit for miners will be the fees. A miner only gets the fees for blocks they solve, but has to expend resources to store, transfer and verify all blocks, including those mined by others. So all mining farm operating expenses are pretty much constant \u2014 hashing goes on constantly, new transactions to store arrive in roughly the same rate. The only variable is how many fees they collect. Because of this, it makes sense to maximize the profit by including all transactions paying any fee, no matter how small that fee. Let's say 1BCH = $1 million, so 1 satoshi = 1 cent. 1.8 million transactions are waiting in the mempool to be confirmed, potentially making a 1GB block. Even if all of those transactions have a fee of just 1 satoshi, that's $18000 profit for this single block. If half of them had a 2 satoshi fee, one could just include those transactions for the same profit, but another $9000 profit would be missed. It makes sense to include all paying transactions to maximize the profit.\n\nWhat's to stop miners from only mining transactions with, say, 100 satoshi fees or more, thus getting 100 times bigger profit? Nothing of course, but since it is a free market, someone else will create a mining farm/pool to scoop up the profits from the huge demand for cheaper transations. Then the cheapest transactions might not get included right away, but they will. Only if it's unprofitable for anyone to mine them, will they not be included, and even then, some miners might include at least some low-fee (or free) transactions just for the good of network, subsidizing the cheap transactions with the profits from the higher-paying ones.", 9], ["2017-11-02 07:25:27", "Is b2x owning by blockstream as well?", 3], ["2017-11-02 05:22:49", "BCH will continue to scale to keep fees down.", 2], ["2017-11-02 07:48:22", "That's the purpose of BCH is to be enable for faster and cheaper transactions as long as there are enough miners backing the project.", 2], ["2017-11-02 17:22:25", "> Bitcoin Cash is the future in payments. \n\nNo its not.

Batches happen at irregular intervals, with about 4 to 20 minutes per batch. It looks like it might be one batch per block.\n\nThe spammer is reusing addresses heavily. Most of the addresses I've looked at for this spam attack show around 600 to 800 transactions in their history between Jan 13, 2018 and now (Jan 14th). A transaction for any one address will involve many or most of the other addresses in the spammer's repertoire.\n\nThe spammer is using a fan-out, fan-in pattern. The transactions either have one output and many inputs, or they have 1-2 inputs and many outputs. \n\nBatches appear to comprise transaction chains. That is, the spammer is publishing transactions that depend on unconfirmed transactions.\n\nThe transactions are large, on the order of 5 kB to 10 kB each.\n\nThe value sent in each transaction is small, typically about 0.001 BCH per transaction or 0.00001 BCH per input (fan-in) or output (fan-out). \n\nThe transactions are all spending 1 satoshi per byte. The transactions are spending about 10% of their input value in fees.\n\nIt would be neat if someone could calculate how much BCH the spammer has inside these addresses; given that, we might be able to calculate how long this can continue for before the spammer runs out of funds (unless he adds more from an external source, of course). For example, if there's 0.001 BCH per address and 1000 addresses, that would be 1 BCH total, which means that this could go on for about one more day.", 9], ["2018-01-15 05:40:24", "A better metric might be how many BCH of unconfirmed fees are in the mempool. If someone is spamming mempool with low-fee transactions, that doesn't affect users. It only affects users if the spam fees are greater than the typical user fees. \n\nCurrently, there's about 1.4 BCH of pending transaction fees in the Bitcoin Cash mempool, or about $3,450. In contrast, Bitcoin Core has about 143 BTC in its mempool, or about $1,945,372. Bitcoin Core's mempool is therefore 563x more congested than Bitcoin Cash's mempool.\n\nThe only effective anti-spam measure that Bitcoins have is fees. It is not possible to maintain an empty mempool or empty blocks against a committed adversary. All that can be done is forcing the spammers to spend more in fees than they can afford. At an average of 4 MB per block, it would about $15k per day to spam Bitcoin Cash with 1 sat/byte fees.
