It's possible that Proof of Stake and scaling can not be programed with decentralized incentives and some economic theory shows that scaling requires centralization. I believe this is low risk.\n\n2. Failure of governance. Much like the bitcoin's blocksize debate. The community devolves into toxic factions and the mainstream population ignores us while the enthusiasts can't agree on features / improvements. Low to Medium level of risk.\n\n3. Lack of Common Goods funding. I personally wish \"tax\" was built in at a protocol level. The blockchain in its wildest dreams needs to be for the whole damn world. No one can own it or have influence over it, as if they do, I suspect it's only a matter of time before it is corrupted and co-opted just as badly as the current system is. To fufill the social promise of the power of decentralization, the chain needs its own sovereignty. It needs to be able to tax it's users via inflation at some multiple of network fees (not via block reward as that reduces security). Using prediction markets / futarchy we can spend the inflation on Common Goods like blockchain development, all types of research, dApps, roads, hospitals, basic income (once the AIs take all our jobs), healthcare, insurance, social programs, etc... The end goal is that nations states mostly fade into the background and blockchain based dApps take on 90% of all world governance mechanisms and social programs. While I think this risk of corporate capture is low on short time scales, it seems inevitable and ever-present on long time scales.\n\n4. Corporate funded fork/competitors such as Open Ledger Project from IBM / R3 / Linux Foundation. Medium level of risk. Would be high risk if we didn't already have a great development community and proven use cases for the public chain (stablecoins, prediction markets, decentralized exchanges, etc.).", 12], ["2016-02-29 12:55:39", "There are a few things:\n\n**Proof of Stake.** It's not that I remain unconvinced, exactly. But when you compare the traditional cryptocurrency POW system to that of the modified POS system described [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/), POW seems more \"dependable\", for lack of a better word. We know POW works, and while POS *seems like it should work*, POW is just simpler and better tested.\n\n**In practice, dApps feel very \"alpha\".** Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to be said for a functional prototype. And I have tons of respect for all the work that's been done so far. But we're just so early in the game with dApps that I don't think we have the best grasp yet of what their strengths and weaknesses are.\n\n**Low hashing power.** See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethinvestor/comments/487xn5/is_ethereum_more_susceptible_to_attack_than/) I just threw up.\n\nIn general though, I'm pretty excited.

I'm not too worried about it, since between formal proofs, peer review, and extensive testing it ought to be pretty well validated. But it's new technology.\n\nBut it's possible for Ethereum to succeed and leave ETH behind, if people mainly use other currencies on Ethereum. ETH's direct value from transaction fee payments is minuscule, and from staking is fairly modest. Using ETH as a currency is what really drives its value. But it has a giant head start and a privileged position, and currencies have network effects, so I think we're in good shape here too.\n\nCompetition from other advanced blockchains is another possible threat, but so far I haven't found anything that worries me.", 4], ["2016-03-02 06:11:17", "One main concern, at the moment, is the formation of a large bubble whose potential popping will turn off investors, developers and therefore slow the speed of adoption.  \n\nThe arrival of \"proof of stake\" next year, and hence transaction limits, is what has many in the Ethereum community are very enthusiastic about valuation.  Yes, there is potential, but let's look at some numbers.  Let's assume Ethereum is operating under proof of stake right now.  Currently, there are about 20,000 transactions per day--just check your favorite blockchain explorer.  Under proof of stake, the ether owners who stake will be entitled to the aggregate transaction fees in Ethereum.  If we assume that the fee is  $0.005 per transaction, that works out to $100 per day, or $36,500 per year.  \n\nLet's think about this:  If you could buy every single ether in existence today at the current price, you would have to spend around $565 million.  And that half a billion dollar investment would entitle you to a whopping $36,500 in total annual fees, all else equal.  That's it.  \n\nNow this is where a bull would quickly point out that transaction numbers are going to go up a lot, and adoption growth, etc etc...\n\nBut let's look at some more numbers.  If we assume that a reasonable person would want a 5% return on a risky investment--a conservative assumption--that implies $28 million in required annual transaction fees--for a $565 million investment.  And $28 million in annual fees implies a necessary 15.34 million in number of transactions PER DAY, assuming the same transaction fee of $0.005.  But, if there were that many transactions, the fee per transaction would probably be much less, necessitating even more transactions to justify the current market cap.  \n\nIt's doubtful any rational person in the Ethereum community thinks that by this time next year there will be anything close 15mm transactions per day, yet that is what the current market cap is implying.  \n\nThis technology has promise, but in my view, this is clearly a bubble and when one day, when the Ethereum skies don't look as clear blue anymore, as they do today, many will then realize the power of the madness of crowds.

If in 2 years time ETH will be $20-50,  roughly 500-1000% plus the potential of tx fees from POS, are we to believe that slock dao will be able to outpace this growth?\n\nThe way I see it: if ETH fails, all dapps will go down with it; if dapps succeed, ETH will be boosted; if some/most dapps fail, ETH still has a chance of going up.\n\nWould love to get another perspective on this matter.

I'm not sure why you are getting downvoted by the way, because that's a good question.\n\nThe quick answer is that 'it depends on the terms of the proposal from the Contractor(s)' - and then it's up to the DAO to approve these terms or not, just like in the real world. \n\nThe longer answer requires to take a practical example. As you know, the DAO votes on proposals from Contractors. The DAO framework we built and made fully open source (https://github.com/slockit/DAO) is suitable for any vertical, but the context of our proposal is at the intersection of Blockchain + IoT.\n\nIn a few weeks, the GmbH will be submitting a proposal to the DAO for the creation of the Ethereum Computer and its ecosystem, including setting up distribution channels, etc. Needless to say, software and hardware will both be part of the deliverables -  and both of which will require a license. \n\nOur opinion - reflected in the proposal terms - is that it's in the DAOs advantage to see both the software (in the form of an app deployable on any object running ubuntu core) and the hardware (in the form of the EC) distributed as widely as possible. \n\nFor example, to encourage creativity, it should be possible for home enthusiasts to replicate an EC using off-the-shelf parts without having to buy it directly from a distributor. Another example: if any given lock manufacturer wanted to be able to embed the software as part of their own designs, in order to benefit from the small but growing incremental revenue provided by the crypto space, then in our view, nothing should get in their way either.\n\nFor these reasons, the proposal we'll submit to the DAO will state that all the code and design that form the output of the work will be licensed as freely as possible (currently set to be LGPL, but we are considering MIT). \n\nOn that note, if you'd like to participate in the discussions on how the DAO and Contractors could collaborate, and help define the type of license the code + hardware will be released under our proposal, feel free to join the #DAO channel on our [slack](http://slock.it:3000/).", 1]]}, "262": {"created": "2016-02-18 14:22:13", "title": "Any ideas what Stephen Tual's \"Big News\" might be?", "num_comments": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "score": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2016-02-18 22:59:18", "http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/innovation/forget-about-oil-your-next-car-will-run-on-ethereum/ \n\nhttp://www.rwe.com/web/cms/en/1029638/rwe/about-rwe/profile/", 6], ["2016-02-18 22:57:11", "[deleted]", 4], ["2016-02-18 22:58:03", "Maybe presale for Slock.it tokens?", 4], ["2016-02-18 22:23:38", "[**@stephantual**](https://twitter.com/stephantual):\n>[2016-02-18 12:30:01 UTC](https://twitter.com/stephantual/status/700296207713902592)\n\n>Hang on to your seats, big news coming today :\\)\n\n----\n\n[^[Mistake?]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Error%20Report&message=/46ext2%0A%0APlease leave above link unaltered.)\n[^[Suggestion]](/message/compose/?to=TweetPoster&subject=Suggestion)\n[^[FAQ]](/r/TweetPoster/comments/13relk/)\n[^[Code]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster)\n[^[Issues]](https://github.com/buttscicles/TweetPoster/issues)\n", 1], ["2016-02-19 01:14:15", "The rwe stuff was announced last week on feb 11 \n\nhttps://blog.slock.it/partnering-with-rwe-to-explore-the-future-of-the-energy-sector-1cc89b9993e6#.xqt4kpytt", 2], ["2016-02-18 23:01:25", "Where did you hear two weeks ?", 3], ["2016-02-18 23:20:37", "I think he is just joking.

So I'm thinking that's the point where we can get mass adoption, beyond what Bitcoin achieved.\n\nSo the main thing I track is whether it looks like we'll get there within the next year or two, and it's looking good. Prior to that, I'm not really worried about adoption levels. \n\nI worried about the low price shortening Foundation runway, but I think now they've locked in some gains from the recent runup.\n\nI look at potential competitors.

Ether will do a lot better if it remains the most popular currency on Ethereum. At least some major dapps are using ether as currency, so things are looking good there too. \n\nOf course, maintaining a high market cap would help incline devs toward using ether as money.

And this post was written by a liar.\n\nI\u2019m James, CEO and co-Founder of Exsulcoin. I\u2019m writing in response to this post, which is full of false statements, which, I believe, are a malicious attack intended to hurt the Rohingya, a stateless people living between Burma and Bangladesh who are currently suffering through a massive refugee crisis.\n\nFirst, some facts. The Poster, u/eha882 is hiding behind anonymity. If his post were grounded in truth, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about revealing himself. Put it another way: Edward Snowden went up against the United States government, and didn\u2019t try to hide his identity. There\u2019s something incredibly suspicious about someone who wants to attack refugees but won\u2019t tell anyone who he is.\n\nNot everything the poster wrote was false; however, it was written in a way to deceive you, the reader. You see, the Poster uses \u201chalf-truths,\u201d where you are told part of the story, but not the whole thing, and the missing information leads you to believe things that are untrue.\n\nOur corporate name is indeed FaircapX, Inc. We are indeed domiciled in Delaware. We use our brand, Exsulcoin, to identify us, to avoid confusion. This is a pretty common practice. Google, for instance, is actually Alphabet, Inc., but they continue to use the Google brand, so you won\u2019t be confused. We incorporated in Delaware because it\u2019s a business-friendly state, and we wanted to pay our taxes as Americans. You see, we work in Myanmar and Bangladesh, among other places.

But I think protecting investors is a good thing.\n\nThe poster states: \u201cAs of January 17, 2017, the Exsul Coin Smart Contract has zero transactions, no XUL tokens have been transferred, and the Exsul Coin wallet is empty.\u201d\n\nIn January 2017, we didn\u2019t have a working smart contract. That said, let me explain how our ICO smart contract works. When someone signs up on the exsulcoin.com website, he receives a unique public key to send ETH so they may be exchanged for XUL tokens (this unique public key is the basis for your very own Exsulcoin wallet). This unique public key is tied to an individual user--it's YOUR key, and we do that so we can later link identity verification and other documentation to it, like refugee status determination. Since this public key is unique, and defines the activity of a specific person, it would show zero transactions if YOU didn't transact anything. The Poster didn't send any ETH through his account and hence, saw zero transactions.\n\nBecause the Poster seems to not understand this, I suspect he may not have any programming skill or understanding of smart contracts. Indeed, he chooses to use term, \u201cthe blockchain,\u201d as if there were only one blockchain\u2014THE blockchain\u2014and we all know that\u2019s not true.\n\nFurther, I don\u2019t believe the Poster knows anything about ICOs, in general. While it\u2019s true we haven\u2019t sent anyone any XUL tokens, that\u2019s because we would never send out tokens before the ICO date. ICO, for the Poster\u2019s reference, stands for \u201cInitial Coin Offering,\u201d which, in plain English, means \u201cthe first time the coin is offered.\u201d Our ICO date is February 12th, 2018.\n\nLying to prospective investors about how much money you\u2019ve raised is unethical.

The rest of the quote is as follows: \u201cWe will be using the fiat funds and the remaining operations ETH to compensate devs and early contributors.\u201d The money for paying developers and early contributors had to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is me: I back my own project fully.\n\nIt\u2019s always heartbreaking to encounter evil people who would hide behind anonymity so they could sabotage humanitarian aid, especially to refugees. Unfortunately, it\u2019s nothing new: working with refugees sometimes means encountering some of the scummiest people on Earth: human traffickers, drug smugglers, racists, and bigots. Clearly, the Poster is a combination of these things.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly proud of the work we do at Exsulcoin. Here is a video from Mohammed Shafi, a Rohingya refugee living in the Kutupalong Rohingya Refugee Camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh: https://youtu.be/yZhMJhc_btA\n\nShafi made this video because of people like this Poster, people who use lies and deceit to harm the weak and the poor of the world. Exsulcoin, actually, was designed to remove non-stakeholders (like the Poster) from the ecosystem, by tokenizing humanitarian aid. In the future, malicious, unfounded attacks like this will be linked to an individual\u2019s on-chain reputation\u2014you will have to own up to the things you say about other people. I think responsibility is a good thing.\n\nFinally, I\u2019d like to end this on a good note. At Exsulcoin, we believe a world free of hate is not only possible, but achievable. Just a few days ago, I traveled to Bangladesh so I could spend New Years with my team at Kutupalong. I delivered ice cream\u2014an enormously difficult task to accomplish, considering the lack of electricity and 90-degree heat\u2014so their children could start their year with a party, a party filled with laughter and smiles and joy. These children have done nothing to deserve the suffering they currently endure, and I\u2019m glad Exsulcoin can make their lives a bit better. The Exsulcoin team at Kutupalong consists mainly of women Rohingya refugees, and they are some of the kindest and brightest people I know. If you didn\u2019t know, the Rohingya are predominantly Muslim and, as such, women are not allowed outside. Well, we all conspired to bend the rules a bit and snuck outside for a brief moment, to make you this New Year\u2019s video: https://youtu.be/jC3_p9HFMco\n\nI wish you a world with less hate, and more peace.", 2], ["2018-01-20 01:53:08", "Looks like this guy is a scammer.

I\u2019m writing in response to this post, which is full of false statements, which, I believe, are a malicious attack intended to hurt the Rohingya, a stateless people living between Burma and Bangladesh who are currently suffering through a massive refugee crisis.\n\nFirst, some facts. The Poster, u/eha882 is hiding behind anonymity. If his post were grounded in truth, he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about revealing himself. Put it another way: Edward Snowden went up against the United States government, and didn\u2019t try to hide his identity.

We are indeed domiciled in Delaware. We use our brand, Exsulcoin, to identify us, to avoid confusion. This is a pretty common practice. Google, for instance, is actually Alphabet, Inc., but they continue to use the Google brand, so you won\u2019t be confused. We incorporated in Delaware because it\u2019s a business-friendly state, and we wanted to pay our taxes as Americans. You see, we work in Myanmar and Bangladesh, among other places. We could\u2019ve incorporated in any one of these other places to reduce our tax liability, but we didn\u2019t want to play that game; so we incorporated in the United States, where every investor in Exsulcoin would have the full protection afforded by the US government.\n\nThe poster seems to think this is a bad thing.

Given high usage of ether, either by former banking services like payments, or with the much broader usage in a wide IoT economy, store of value properties follow. High usage mean lower probability of a currency or commodity becoming obsolete. If ether is a solid part of the economic infrastructure, and inflation kept low with PoS, it should also be attractive to use as a store of value, adding further to total value.\n\nWhat can maybe be explored more is the issue of deflation, which has been commonly thrown as criticism against bitcoin\u2019s issuance model (which should apply also to the Ethereum PoS issuance model). Smart people from The Economists, and former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis have put forward such arguments. The criticism is basically: added money supply is less than the appreciation of the crypto currency as it becomes more mainstream/integrated. This would lead to deflationary pressure if large groups of workers are being paid in the crypto currency since they will hodl rather than spend. However, my initial thoughts on this issue was: (1) If we have reached so far that large groups of people get paid in ether, the value is already far larger than today\u2019s, and (2) if the appreciation of ether causes dangerous systemic deflation in country X, wouldn\u2019t the depreciation of the official country X currency counter balance that with an increase of inflation for workers still paid in that currency? \n", 3], ["2016-03-21 10:10:56", "Well the derivatives market is like $700 trillion so I mean smart contracts technically could overtake the derivatives market someday so $700 trillion? :)", 2], ["2016-04-12 13:51:25", "I think that various forms of credit, escrow, and transactions will create the most support for the network valuation of ethereum.

Then you use the gold to back more DAI. The gold loses value over time due to storage fees and so the the value backing the DAI is reduced as well.\n\nEven if collateral is $100 USD worth of digix gold and collateral is 2:1. You get $50 worth of DAI to spend on gold again, which if collateralized again creates $25 of DAI... etc. $100 USD of Gold is now backing $50 + $25 + $12.5... so yes I see now, solving the infinite series results in the collateral generaring 1:1 DAI.\n\nSo the question is still if the Gold falls in value who's penalized for that most directly? Is it only the people that used gold to back their DAI?", 1], ["2016-03-17 22:16:45", "The infinite series of CDP creation at 200% collateralization (2:1) results in you holding zero DAI, with 2x exposure to your collateral asset, not 1:1.\n\ne.g. $200 GLD --[CDP]-> $100 DAI --[EX]-> $100 GLD --[CDP]-> $50 DAI --[EX]-> $50 GLD --[CDP]-> $25 DAI ...\n\nwhere [CDP] is CDP creation and [EX] represents an exchange. \n\n~~All that you end up with after going through this is your initial $200 GLD that is locked as collateral in the first CDP. If you'd just held the GLD you'd have had the same result, except without paying transaction fees and maker insurance!~~\n\nIf gold falls in value it is you who is penalised, ~~just as if you were holding gold.~~\n\nYour maximum exposure *e* (i.e. leverage) to any asset, with collateral requirement *c* (e.g. 200% : c = 2, 150% : c = 1.5), is given by\n\n    e = c / (c - 1)\n\n(since circular CDP creation is just a geometric series)\n\nSome example max exposures for different collateral requirements:\n\n\nCollateral | Max exposure\n---|---\n200% | 2x\n150% | 3x\n133% | 4x\n125% | 5x\n120% | 6x\n\nNote that you could have got the same exposure with less effort (and less exchange fees) if you had just found a counterparty to sell the issued Dai to.\n\nIssuing the Dai to yourself does make sense if you want to gain less exposure than the maximum, but I think you could achieve the same thing by just over collateralizing your initial CDP (e.g. providing 250% collateral).\n\n    \n---\n\n> So the question is still if the Gold falls in value who's penalized for that most directly? Is it only the people that used gold to back their DAI?\n\n\nNo, it is the people that used gold to *issue* DAI. In your example you have issued to yourself.\n\nIf you had issued $100 DAI to someone else, taking their $100 GLD as payment, and collateralizing with your $100 GLD, then you would be effectively 2x leveraged on GLD.

The present value is based on people's expectations of future ether GDP, discounted for risk and time value of money.\n\nWorst case for ether, assuming Ethereum succeeds, is that nobody uses ether for anything besides staking. In that case, the value is determined only by transaction fees.

I think that's a reasonable proxy for the value of all monetary tokens running on an Ethereum world computer in the future. At 20% ETH, that gives a value of 14 trillion for ETH.\n\nI am guessing that ETH will switch to >1% ETH inflation to pay for security after the change to proof-of-stake. So let's estimate approximately 100 million ETH are available in 10 years (which is my rough estimate for when Ethereum will have fully \"taken over\" money).

Instead of paying Uber 25% to hook the rider and driver, we use this smart contract to do the same job Uber served.\n\nOK, that's all fine and dandy, but someone has to actually build the thing. One way is to essentially do a fundraiser/charity event, but wo wants to just throw money at something with no promise of a return. There needs to be an incentive. We've learned this over and over again the last 2000 years.\n\nOK, so that being said, a team gets together and writes a whitepaper on how this Uber replacement would function, get created, etc etc. The white paper takes 3 months of criticism, questioning, revisions, etc.\n\nIn the end, folks like you and I read the white paper and understand how it's going to work and if we like it we can buy some tokens.\n\nLet's say the ICO happens and you can buy these Uber replacement tokens for $0.01. One single cent. Hey! That's pretty cheap.\n\nThere's a finite supply, so it won't dilute. The dev team holds onto like 10% or maybe 20% as an incentive just like you have for putting up money up front.\n\nThe app gets built over 6-12 months and finally launches. The first ride is around the same cost as an Uber, only now since the proof of concept works, the tokens you bought for $0.01 are now worth, oh, say $0.20. Wow, nice return. So you can get a ride for 30 tokens (30x.20 = $6) but in reality it only costs you $0.30 (30 tokens @ $0.01).\n\nImagine if you had bought 1MM tokens. Holy shit. $10k in tokens is now worth $200k.
