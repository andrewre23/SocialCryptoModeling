A great example was [this tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/ArminVanBitcoin/status/965668127886467077), which briefly reached the front page of /r/Bitcoin despite [every single claim in it being (at least a little) wrong](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7yqw9z/comment/duj7v7p).\n\nWe need to be honest and face facts head on, regardless of whether those facts are encouraging or discouraging, welcome or lamentable, and no matter what \"side of the aisle\" we consider ourselves to be on. You're right.\n\nWith my \"I agree, you're right\" out of the way... time to honor what this subreddit is all about.\n\n>We're not going to continue to have low fees on chain with the direction we are going.\n\nWhile I think this is *probably* true, and I'm certainly not going to go on the record boldly predicting the opposite, I also have my doubts. Hear me out.\n\n*Hypothetically*, assume for the moment that \"actual economic usage\" of the blockchain is somewhere around the 500-700kB/block range (as Luke-Jr has famously argued at times), and that with batching and \"responsible practices\" this could be reduced to the 300-500kB range. This would mean that the other 300-800kB of data per block is mostly comprised of wasteful and/or *malicious*, politically-motivated \"spam\" (which has also been argued plenty of times). This would have recently evolved into a relatively expensive spam campaign, *unless* there were other factors which made it cheaper to execute, such as: 1) miners being involved in the campaign (especially if it is a coalition of miners with a significant portion of the overall network hashrate), allowing the bulk of the spam transactions to be scooped up by the spammers themselves, costing them next-to-nothing; 2) a young and unprepared ecosystem that hadn't yet developed intelligent fee-estimation algorithms or services to contend with the new network circumstances; 3) powerful and relatively-unchallenged on-ramp services (with big barriers-to-entry barring many would-be competitors) being able to get away with \"lazy\" practices like \"*always* massively overpaying network fees without offering users options to adjust this parameter\" and \"offloading fees to the sender\" without significant negative impact on their revenue; 4) a large influx of FOMO-driven, embarrassingly uninformed newcomers who don't know enough to effectively minimize their \"blockchain footprint\" as they scramble into the space; 5) the possibility to offset expenditures via profiting in other, more *oblique* manners (like the eventual launch of a competing coin, aggressively marketed as \"the real deal\", which offers a capitalization opportunity on the deliberately-imposed pain points of the original network).\n\nIn particular, 2, 3, and 4 have the potential to result in cascading feedback loop phenomena, where (theoretically) relatively small levels of input have profound effects on the mean and median confirmation fee rates for the network itself. The incentives to orchestrate such a campaign *do* exist (especially if there are *other* factors at play, like the desire to retain a 20-30% competitive advantage in the form of a mining exploit, the possible backing or involvement of a nation-state (or multiple) which has given instructions to amass as much potential leverage over the network as possible, or the straightforward desire for more control or power for its own sake). I am not trying to build up a particular conspiracy theory so much as I am pointing out that the motivation for doing something like this is easily understandable, makes perfect sense, and *does* serve as a reasonable hypothesis in terms of explaining a lot of what we've seen over the past year or two.\n\nSo what relevance does this have to the fees we see now and those we will see moving forward in Bitcoin? Well, the \"feedback loop potential\" of 2, 3, and 4 above is pretty much neutralized after the ecosystem is able to muster together a response and adjust to the stimuli, however disorganized, slow, or ugly that response might seem in the moment. This response combined with the development of second-layer tech means that any such campaign has a limited window of opportunity during which 5 remains realistically possible to pull off, and the prospects of success for this sort of stunt diminish dramatically if a critical mass isn't achieved early on. And if you are a miner involved in such a campaign, you are now faced with a dilemma: either your hashpower is allocated to the original chain (meaning that 1 is still at play), or dedicated to the new one (meaning that 5 is), or it's *divided between both* to hedge your bets... which diminishes the effectiveness of both. Opportunity cost suddenly becomes a much harsher enemy.\n\nIn other words, if such a campaign *was* taking place, it's likely that it would now start to be experiencing diminishing returns, and past a certain point, it just ceases to be cost-effective to maintain.\n\n*If* the \"spam attack\" was a real thing, and having a pronounced effect on transaction fee-rates, and if the above has an element of truth to it... well, we might be in for a less-expensive on-chain experience than we had started to think. If the capacity boost of SegWit is taken full advantage of, if Lightning Network is able to offload a significant level of traffic from layer one, and if competition continues to claw at the heels of the big players in the industry, we might actually be able to get by with minimal confirmation fees for a lot longer than we had hoped. And if we're lucky, and we manage to get far enough ahead of both Nielsen's and Moore's respective laws, and engineering optimizations or breakthroughs continue to be made in the background, who knows how well things could play out?\n\nI don't know.

I would like to ask a question since this seems like an audience that might have a good answer. I am not making an argument here, it is really a question.\n\nOver time, I have become a believer in the idea that Bitcoin will find its place as a store of value instead of a medium of exchange. Because of this, I have not been overly concerned with fees and confirmation times, and I agree that second layer and off-chain solutions are the correct ways to address the issues. Most of the complaints about Bitcoin seem to be either shortsighted concerns about turning profit on speculation, or an attempt to hold on to an old belief that Bitcoin is for buying pizza even though other solutions have come around in the last several years that are much better mediums of exchange. \n\nMy question: Since the role of Bitcoin seems to have changed to that of a store of value, what will keep Bitcoin from becoming outdated and replaced with something new?

Transaction fees have been linked with the effectiveness of scaling solutions in wierd ways in the public discourse to the point where they end up confusing a lot of the issues. Its better if we can talk about them in more honest ways, but those conversations tend to be more sophisticated and not suitable to tweets and trolling on Reddit. It's also hard to have those kinds of conversations in the context of crypto traders with a short term outlook hoping to go to the moon.\n\nI also believe this goes beyond Bitcoin as well. Fees on any blockchain network will be cheap right up until the point where we reach capacity and then they will start climbing dramatically. I am more in the Ethereum camp, but I cringe a bit when people trumpet Ethereum's low fees as proof of a better network since it has the same fundamental issues that Bitcoin has. The network's parameters are tuned to allow a higher level of throughput, but its only about a 4x difference. Both networks need second layer scaling solutions. Both networks are currently slighly under capacity and therefore cheap, but not very far away from reaching full capacity and seeing dramatic fee increases again.\n\nI think the thing that frustrates me most about this entire disourse is the way it is approached by the Bitcoin Core devs. It feels like they could improve the situation by focusing more on education with less focus on trolling and antagonizing any opposition.", 1], ["2018-02-23 06:01:23", "I believe yes, too early.\n\nFees actually dropped BEFORE Segwit, so it is not because of segwit.\n\nI strongly believe it is because number of transactions and daily volume went down dramatically because of very high fees, which lead to reduced demand, which lead to reduced price, more reduced demand.... a viscous downward cycle unfortunately.\n\nI won\u2019t repeat again all what I have posted on the r/Bitcoin that caused me to be banned there.

But we should be precise about the positives.  If newcomers show up, and we are all cheering how segwit got us low fees because \"it's working\", and then one month later fees are high again, we don't want them to think that \"it's not working any more\".  It feeds the very disinformation campaigns you're talking about.", 3], ["2018-02-21 21:34:34", "Unfortunately you are perpetuating a false dichotomy which was created as part of the disinformation campaigns I already mentioned in my other comment. \n\nBitcoin is neither a simple store of value, nor is it primarily a medium of exchange. Instead it is a decentralized consensus network that facilitates censorship resistant value transfer while eliminating the need for trust in any third party. Both store of value and medium of exchange are use cases that emerge from these properties, and both these and other use cases can coexist without problem.\n\nThere is no conspiracy by anyone to turn Bitcoin into a store of value while maliciously disregarding other use cases. The current development however focuses on the properties of Bitcoin that make it valuable in the first place, such as the aforementioned decentralization and censorship resistance. Without these fundamental properties, Bitcoin would be worthless, and there would be nothing of value to exchange.\n\nIt's also annoying to see how the narrative that second layers such as LN are \"not really Bitcoin\" has found its way into the subconscious of the casual observer. The disinformation campaigns seem to work quite well. Lightning transactions are just as much bitcoin transactions as any other, the only difference is that their intermediate state is being recorded on a different layer until it becomes finalized (aka closing the channel). It has all the same properties of the \"real\" Bitcoin, because that's what is being transacted.\n\nSo in summary: The fundamental properties of Bitcoin that make it valuable give birth to different use cases, and these different use cases can be improved upon by creating intermediate second layers. There is no dilemma of having to choose between a store of value or a medium of exchange.", 5], ["2018-02-22 10:20:27", "Forks with \"initial coin(fork) offering\" is a good marketing strategy.  Given bitcoin has the most audience, the ultimate winner coin is highly possible some fork now or future.

So the adoption has to come first, and *then* the token can fill a medium-of-exchange niche or role successfully. And the primary driver of adoption is *economic rationality*, or to put it more bluntly: *greed*.\n\nIt's clear that the order of operations must go: \"good store-of-value first, then good medium-of-exchange next\" and that the other way around doesn't really make sense. Why would ordinary people accept bitcoins as payment if they didn't consider them valuable first? This is a hurdle that fiat monies don't have to overcome these days, but it's one that Bitcoin definitely does. First, society must come to value bitcoins (we're getting there), and *then* those coins will start flowing, as that demand manifests in the open marketplace. Merchants should be offering discounts to me if I pay them in BTC (and, needless to say, should be keeping those BTC rather than converting them to fiat)... if they don't, I don't see much advantage to myself in giving up my awesome future-money rather than my old dinosaur-money when it comes time to check out. We're moving in the right direction, but it's a process.\n\n\n>attempt to hold on to an old belief that Bitcoin is for buying pizza even though other solutions have come around in the last several years that are much better mediums of exchange.\n\nThis is a *very* confused statement. There aren't really other solutions that have come around like that... there are younger, less-used, and better-marketed spinoffs that have managed to *trick* people who don't know any better into believing that they are \"better\" because there is currently less demand for them (or because they are willing to accept a degree of centralization into their base layer, or both).\n\nRealize that for the first 6 years or so, Bitcoin had zero-fee transactions (just like these newer coins do). But the Bitcoin from  years ago isn't technically superior to the Bitcoin today; **the opposite is true!** It has improved *massively* across the board... it is just farther along in its life cycle now, and not compromising the core features that make it valuable and interesting and worthwhile in the first place.\n\nFurthermore, pretty much any good and large network or system is built in layers or stacks. Cramming everything into one layer is just dumb engineering. The cypherpunks who were involved in building and supporting Bitcoin from the very beginning were talking about how secondary layers would be built on top of the underlying blockchain foundation... we're just now starting to see these built. To dismiss Bitcoin as a \"poor medium-of-exchange\" (*especially* relative to altcoins) at this stage is short-sighted and, to put it lightly, a little bit silly.\n", 6], ["2018-02-22 02:58:44", "> what will keep Bitcoin from becoming outdated and replaced with something new?\n\nIn short: its head start. Bitcoin has so much more adoption than any other cryptocurrency that it will almost definitely hit mainstream use first. Once the acceleration of it's adoption curve starts trailing off, only then will better currencies be able to *begin* gaining ground on it. \n\nRemember Metcalf's law. Bitcoin is a network and the value of a network is proportional to the square of it's number of users. If bitcoin triples it's users, its value should go up by 900% (value, not price mind you). This is also why it's likely there *will* be a single winner. The network is most valuable when everyone's on it. Therefore any competing currency wouldn't likely be used *instead* of bitcoin, but rather alongside bitcoin. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that most features can be incorporated into bitcoin. Some altcoin has a better hashing algorithm?  Bitcoin can adopt it. Bigger blocks are shown to be safe? Bitcoin can adopt it. Proof of stake ends up working out? Bitcoin can adopt it. Someone finally writes a killer app for ethereum? Bitcoin can adopt it (as a rootstock app). Any altcoin that has features that could be adopted by bitcoin of those features prove valuable or competitive against bitcoin are doomed to failure since their tech can be absorbed.\n\nThere are features that can't be easily adopted by bitcoin tho. Hugely different consensus chains like DAGs are unlikely to be adopted by bitcoin, even if they succeed, just cause you'd have to rip out most of what makes bitcoin bitcoin. Tho even that could be adopted as a side chain. Also, the types of privacy features monero or zcash have are unlikely to be adopted by bitcoin since they have fundamental tradeoffs (their transactions are much larger than bitcoins, the chain is no longer public and auditable, and the utxo set grows quadratically) and their usefulness is only maximized when those features are part of the main chain. If features like that prove valuable and in demand, one of then might beat out bitcoin one day. But not before bitcoin goes mainstream.", 2], ["2018-02-23 07:36:17", "> Well, I wonder if I\u2019ll be banned and downvoted here as well!\n\nAs a mod: This type of sulking really takes away from any valid point you might have, and probably encourages others to downvote you.

Are we supposed to dig through your posting history to find it?\n\nAlso, your \"vicious downward spiral\" makes zero sense, because if the fees are low again, the spiral has stopped.

Fixating on that particular term (and the implied connotations that it might be laden with) will be nothing but a distraction.

It is slightly cheaper to mine high fee transactions you made yourself compared to letting someone else mine them for you, but there's a big cost in mining your own useless transactions instead of other peoples.\n\nNo, not necessarily. It all depends on the specifics (and unfortunately, unless you're directly involved with the theoretical conspiracy and can thus \"peek behind the curtain\", these are a luxury we don't have at our disposal).\n\nIt's very easy to demonstrate with a quick and simplified thought experiment, though. Imagine you are a big mining pool operator.\n\n* Scenario A: blocks are all 9/10 full, and no users are paying any fees (because they don't have to in order to get confirmed in the next block). You don't submit any transactions of your own, and instead just mine quietly and collect the block rewards.\n\n* Scenario B: blocks are 9/10 full, but you add another 3/10 of the total per-block capacity in transaction volume of your own. With two-thirds of it (2/10 of the block capacity) you pay zero fees on, just like everyone else. The rest of it (1/10) you pay fees of 10 satoshis/byte on. Of course, every block that you mine, you grab your transactions first.\n\nIn Scenario B, you'll lose revenue every now and then, as other miners manage to collect your transactions (assuming you broadcast them regularly, which you can always refrain from doing if you *really* want to get devious). The ratio of transactions which will actually cost you something depends on your total network hash share, of course. But crucially, you'll also guarantee that each block is *more* than filled (even your zero-fee transactions alone would ensure this) and that the transaction backlog is continually growing... triggering actual users who *do* prioritize quick confirmation to start paying fees of their own. Especially in the context of naive (overpaying) fee estimators, services, and wallets, you could trigger a feedback loop in your favor, where people wind up in bidding wars against *each other* while you continue to submit your 10 sat/byte transactions quietly in the background (and unduly prioritize them, of course).\n\nIt's not only *totally possible* that the aggregate network fees resulting from this (and your share thereof) wind up netting you more profits than losses... but it's more likely than not, assuming you are clever and careful enough in your execution.\n\nPretending that this isn't possible (and worse, theoretically rational) and dismissing it as unrealistic is a bit silly, in my opinion.", 2], ["2018-02-22 14:51:30", "> No cryptocurrency is going to be a meaningfully useful medium-of-exchange until the volatility dies down and the network of users (demanders) is large enough\n\n...and the value of each unit is high enough, though that surely would follow if the first two criterion you alluded to happen.

If average fee payments rise above that figure, you can continue scooping your own (now lower-than-average) fee transactions without nearly as much risk of other miners claiming them. Meanwhile, you're mining full blocks of fee-paying transactions and continuing to help the backlog grow, encouraging escalating fee competition (bidding wars) the entire time.\n\nIt's worth noting that this *would* incur opportunity cost; the more of your own transactions you fill your blocks with, the less space there is for *actual* fee-paying transactions that you can reap rewards from. Meanwhile, any other miners who aren't complicit in the attack are realizing the benefits without paying the costs, so this strategy could actually hurt your relative profitability... but part of my point here is that such an attack isn't really indefinitely sustainable. It might temporarily help your short-term profits (especially if the ecosystem is slow to react, and you get to capitalize on a miner-advantageous feedback loop for a bit... or if you're trying to hype an alternative cryptocurrency that you have more control or stake in), but I think the network (and the incentives thereof) is able to handle this sort of attack, given time to respond accordingly. And that's my main point; we may be just starting to witness the effects of this response, as fees drop to more palatable levels. It remains to be seen whether this is a lull or a new, relatively-sustainable norm.\n\n>I haven't done the math, but intuitively I feel like you need 50% of miners to make that profitable.\n\nI don't believe that specific number-crunching is really meaningfully possible without access to more data than either of us have at our disposal, but I think that the simple thought experiment above demonstrates that it is certainly possible for this to be a profitable endeavor. You're right that the larger your hash share, the safer it is for the attacker, though.\n\nI think we're at an interesting point in Bitcoin, and that it's possible that fees remain relatively low (significantly lower than the $20-50 levels that were seen late last year) for many years yet (at least for the users who aren't careless in their network usage, that is... it's always possible to overpay by arbitrary margins). I might be wrong with this, but like I said, I'm ever-optimistic, and I think it's possible that we may have survived a \"perfect storm of fees\" and might see a period of relief now that lasts longer than some might guess.", 3], ["2018-02-22 23:15:45", "> Cryptocurrencies are a lot more alike to a user than myspace and facebook were.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with this. The underlying social graph was similar for both Myspace and Facebook - just like the underlying network for cryptos is similar, but people are definitely using the networks different depending on their capabilities. The kinds of applications that are getting built on the networks are changing how people use them - similar to how Facebook's application platform allowed it to add a lot of value for users.

The total value of Bitcoin would be approximately 1000\\*1000=$1 million, which would also be the market cap.\n\nIf you double the number of users wanting to store $1000, the total market cap now need to be 2000\\*1000=$2 million. That would provide a market cap exactly matching the need. Thus the market cap for this use case is proportional to the number of users, not proportional to the square of the number of users. That means, by definition, that it is not a network effect.\n\nThis can be intuitively understood as follows. Suppose you use Bitcoin as a store of value. This is a functionality of Bitcoin that has a value to you. That is, I am not talking about the value of the bitcoin you own, but the value of this functionality (the service). If we now add another user, also using this service of Bitcoin, it will not change the quality or value of the service for you. There is no benefit for you if another user is added.\n\nAdding more hodlers will obviously increase the price, which is generally seen as a good thing. However, an increasing price is not strictly something you want of a store-of-value service. You want a constant price. If we are talking about investments or speculations, then increasing prices are the main goal of course. But it is detrimental to the store-of-value service.\n\n> > In reality, however, the network effect eventually goes down to something like n\\*log(n)\n\n> How so?\n\nIntuitively, it is easy to understand as follows: Suppose you want to buy things using Bitcoin. If there is a new vendor for TV sets, it adds a value to you. Another TV set vendor makes it even better. But there is a diminishing return; going from 10 TV set vendors to 11 isn't as good for you as going from 0 to 1.\n\nSee [Modified models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law#Modified_models).\n", 1], ["2018-02-25 14:50:20", "> Go ahead, ban me.\n\nOk.", 2], ["2018-02-22 20:22:52", "> What do empty blocks have to do with any of what I said?\n\nSorry, I meant non-full blocks/ zero-fee transactions.\n\nEven if zero-fee transactions were a thing, most, if not all, fee-estimators would propose a zero-fee transaction in your example, since those do get confirmed.\n\n> but I think that the simple thought experiment above demonstrates that it is certainly possible for this to be a profitable endeavor.\n\nI don't think it does.  \n\n> If average fee payments rise above that figure, you can continue scooping your own (now lower-than-average) fee transactions without nearly as much risk of other miners claiming them.\n\nThis doesn't make economical sense.

However, again, that's not how the market (or people) work. Not everyone values those coins the same, and doubling the owners could mean less than double the price, or more than double the price.

Given the links you provided I think you might misunderstand my problem with your statements. I do not in any way dispute that spam attacks can happen, or have happened. The only problem I have, is that you claim these attacks are profitable for miners to execute. That they gain more in fees than they lose.\n\nMy quick response to the links:  \n1: Doesn't say it's profitable, on the contrary  \n2: Doesn't say it's profitable  \n3: Explains a different kind of attack, I don't think you meant this attack as a way to increase fees, if you did, I'll elaborate if you want. The mailing list responses see this as a mempool attack. At the time Bitcoin Core didn't limit the mempool, so it could be attacked by overloading it.  \n5: Doesn't say it's profitable, on the contrary, I quote: \"While the price for these spam attacks is estimated to be in the millions of dollars\"  \n6: Doesn't say it's profitable  \n7: Is about miners attacking the block75 proposal. He mentioned \"miner spam\", but again, nothing about profitability.  \n8: I think \"tx spamming\" refers to pushing loads of transactions to nodes which will not get in blocks any time soon. I could be wrong, but either way, it doesn't talk about it being profitable either so.  \n9: \"rational miners will NOT be incentivized to mine gargantuan spam filled blocks\" refers to low-fee spam in general I think. Either way, no explanation of profitability if it was talking about miner-spam.  \n4: Sorry for the out-of-order numbers, but this was the response I was looking for, so I want to elaborate more on this. I think some assumptions he makes are dubious. His calculation is for attacking a zero-fee blockchain, which we don't have. He also assumes spamming 50 Sat/byte transactions will amount to 750 Sat/byte average blocks.\n\nIf the last assumption is right we can already state the attack is not profitable when the fees without attack exceed the profit from the attack. That's 32 BTC a day, so with 10% hashing power you need 320 BTC in fees a day, which is 2.2 BTC/block. That's not tiny, but not unreasonable high.\n\nThe last assumption feels a bit disingenuous, as he takes the highest fees in the history of Bitcoin and assumes that's what you get when you spam 50 sat/byte transactions. With everything that was going on at that time (Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjustment, price rise with loads of new people coming in), that created a huge demand. Assuming you can re-create that with a 50 Sat/byte attack doesn't seem right. If we look at those high fee blocks from the screenshot, say the first one (500432), the lowest fee-rate was slightly above 100 Sat/byte. While with a 50 Sat/byte attack the lower bound will very likely be 50 Sat/byte, that's half. If we then assume fees will go half as crazy as it did back then, we only get 54 BTC, that's an 18 BTC loss. That's assuming the attack re-creates the conditions when the demand was extremely high, which I don't think is true. Right now people are consolidating transactions, moving funds between wallets, etc. that's an entire different environment than loads of new people coming in, loads of price-action, slow blocks. If you do that attack now, loads of transactions won't be there, leaving space for all those 50 Sat/byte transactions. The transaction-pressure won't be there.\n\nIf the transaction market is on a low pace, spamming transactions won't increase that pace. You make high priority transactions pay more fees, but you price low priority transactions out of the market, so the fees won't increase as much as opposed to when the transaction market is at a high pace.", 0], ["2018-02-24 01:02:58", "There's actually an even easier (and 100% indisputable) way to prove the point *a priori*.

They either understand the tech or they put their trust in someone who does and believe what that person/people say/s. \n\n> you'll still not have the same opinion on what was communicated there as I do\n\nUnless you actively point out an interview I can attempt to re-interpret, its almost certain my biases will prevent me from seeing what you're seeing in them. So looking through an internet full of interviews isn't going to be a good use of my time. But if you point out something, I'll do my best to take a broader perspective in interpreting it. \n\n> How .. does [it unacceptably break the usability of bitcoin, in the eyes of some people?]\n\nMy best understanding of this at the moment is that bitcoin only works if the economic majority (the group of people creating >50% of the transaction volume by worth) actively participates in enforcing their own rules (the rules they choose to follow). If too many people use SPV clients that trust some unknown node to validate for them, shenanigans can happen. Chain splits can happen that are confusing enough that the economic majority follows them unwittingly, even tho they wouldn't consent in a more measured situation. However, if people's SPV clients put their trust in a node they're confident will follow the same rules they want to follow in the case of a chainsplit, this problem is mitigated. \n\nLarger blocks make it less convenient (ie more difficult) to run a bitcoin full node. Storage space is one factor, bandwidth is another, processing power is yet another. Its not enough for those things to be cheap, they also have to be convenient. Someone who has never owned an external hard drive and has a laptop with 200GB of HD space will simply not run a full node even at the current block size. Sure they could buy an external, or rent a server, but that's more than most people are willing to do. \n\nIts an issue I've struggled to understand over the past few weeks, and I still don't think I fully understand the issue of full nodes with regards to decentralization. \n\n> far past release date by now. 2.5 + years at least\n\nThis is certainly the r/btc narrative. Its also not correct. Yes the LN has been talked about for 2.5 years. Schnorr signatures and side chains have as well. But no one wanted to start implementing the lightning network until malleability was fixed (which happened just 5 months ago with segwit). Since segwit was delayed by a full year by .. shall we say dissenting interests .. the lightning network was as well.\n\n> It's tragic to see the network held back for years\n\nIndeed it is.\n\n> nothing else was considered more important than this one specific idea\n\nSomething has to be prioritized right? You can't work on everything all at once, cause then nothing gets done. I think what you're saying is that you think they prioritized the wrong thing. \n\n> some of us have been in Bitcoin almost since the very earliest days\n\nSo have I, but patience isn't patience unless you wait. Better yet, you could contribute and make it happen sooner. I've been thinking about doing that lately..\n\n> if anyone knew we wouldn't have been here\n\nMy hypothetical question about certainty wasn't rhetorical. I'm curious to know your answer. \n\n> Considering how easy making a blocksize increase is\n\nYou're ignoring the fact that simple changes to the bitcoin protocol have complex consequences that involve both computer science and game theory. You can't pick your favorite consequence (more blockspace) and ignore the rest. Perhaps you're right that the consequences are small, but there are many people who disagree. Luckily there is a currency for those that disagree with bitcoin's direction. Many in fact. \n\n> Do you remember this instance? Or this one?\n\nI'm not sure what you hope to communicate to me by pointing out one, or two, or 100 people who said things that are wrong at one time or another. I agree, people have been wrong here and there, and people will continue to be wrong here and there. Its also possible that by \"release\" and \"running\" they meant something different than what you thought they meant. They could have been unintentionally misleading, optimistic, plain dumb-wrong. Who knows, maybe they have their own biasing motivations for saying that stuff. A CEO like Elizabeth Stark certainly has those biases. Certainly you aren't saying that the lightning network will never happen just because some number of people have been wrong about it in the past, right? \n\n> the main chain itself will remain stagnant and restrained\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like this is a necessary property of a secure decentralized ordered list. The way I see it is that humanity developed bitcoin basically as soon as the technology made it even remotely possible. In 100 years, the storage, bandwidth, and processing resources would make today's quibbling about 1MB blocks look like a joke. But for the time being, those bottlenecks are real. Bitcoin has chosen to be the most conservative and slow moving cryptocurrency so that it doesn't break or compromise a $200 billion payment network. The consensus is that its more important to ensure that bitcoin remains secure and decentralized than to lower transaction fees. \n\nBut I wouldn't call on-chain bitcoin development stagnant by any measurement other than blocksize.

If all nodes are run by miners or big businesses, they can gain undue power.\n\n\n>5 year old computers\n\nI didn't make any argument about 5-year-old computers, so this is a strawman argument.

My electricity bill would skyrocket, and my Internet would be less reliable.\n\n> or mobile internet connections with small data caps\n\nAnother strawman, but since 1MB nodes need ~250GB data caps (not including Netflix, etc.), then doesn't it stand to reason that not many individuals would be capable of running a node with 8MB or 16MB blocks? I don't know how bandwidth increase with block size, but assuming it rises proportionately, a 16MB block (which could be required in only a few years' time) would need ~4TB of bandwidth per month (or ~130GB per day).\n\n------\n\nI believe that (all other things being equal) it would be better if people *could* run a node from an old PC on a limited Internet connection. When a 4MB block can provide as much throughput as a 100MB block, everybody wins (that's roughly comparing the throughput of bitcoin + lightning to bitcoin with only on-block scaling).\n\nIt should become *easier* to run nodes in future, not *harder*.

Decentralization, or the ability to resist censorship and control, is bitcoin's central value proposition and reason for being. I'm only trying to make the argument that decentralization is a lot more than just hardware requirements for mining nodes. To borrow your example, I don't think that there is a serious risk that the mining node count will enter double digit (or even low triple digit) territory even if it is very expensive to operate a mining node, *provided that adoption and price appreciation continues*. We can make the linear conjecture that increased hardware requirements will reduce the number of mining and non-mining nodes, but at the same time we also have to consider the positive implications of increased transaction throughput on general willingness to mine / run a non-mining node and thus censorship resistance. \n\nThe more people who use and depend on bitcoin, the harder it becomes for the state to \"shut it down,\" as long as the fundamental model stays intact.\n\nEdit: Another though I just had was: when we talk about node decentralization instead of talking about raw \"number of nodes,\" it might be more useful to consider the *economic weight* of each node.

Has SegWit which fixes malleability, reduces the sighash operations from O( N^2 ) to O(N) (for Segwit transactions), introduces script versioning (easier future sensibility), creates a longer, more secure P2WSH address, and raises the block size limit to theoretically 4MB (effectively 1.8-2.2 MB). \n2. Has bech32 (with some benefits) address for native segwit. \n3. Has replace by fee that allows fee bumping.\n4. Various under the hood improvements in speed and efficiency since 0.14.1. 0.15.1 version is much faster than 0.14.1. \n\nBCH\n\n1. Has 8MB block limits.\n2. Applied BIP143 Sighash, the same as segwit but for legacy transactions making all transactions O(N). \n3. Removed replace by fee completely.\n3. Introduced a different difficulty adjustment algorithm that created a wild swings in mining.\n4. Fixed the broken difficulty adjustment algorithm.\n5. Has not created a new address space which created a lot of confusion and many lost funds for uses mistakenly sending BCH to BTC addresses and vice versa\n6. Created a new address format, fixing 6 but old addresses still work. The new address format is a derivative of bech32 format. \n7.

This is being discussed chapter 11 in the whitepaper (and expanded upon in many later papers). Of course, 1-conf gives a huge amount of confidence over 0-conf, but it isn't really *final*. And 1-conf may not be necessary for small-ish payments.\n\n> There is a financial incentive to accept higher-fee replacement transactions, and even very reasonable honest use cases for it.\n\nSure, but there's also incentives no to and many use cases that are enabled by the miner community in general refraining from doing so. It depends on what kind of use cases and acceptable risks you're aiming for for 0-conf txs (and possibly, in the future, [weak-confs](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/856)).\n\n> Even if the community is vehemently against it, with enough time and miners, there will be some miner willing to accept replacement transactions.\n\nSure, but if history has shown that it very rarely happens, your risk assessment will be positively impacted by that - as compared to a situation where the miners are explicitly expected to *always* choose the higher fee.\n\n> There is no protocol level way to prevent that.\n\nTrue, but I don't think anyone's claiming that (at least not anyone understanding the tech and economics powering the incentives of Bitcoin)?\n\n> And when there's a miner willing to accept those transactions, there will be people that abuse 0-conf by double spending\n\nYes, but it's all about how reliably such fraud attempts can be pulled off. And how much they win (or lose) by succeeding (or failing).\n\n> Anyone who doesn't wait for even a single confirmation opens themselves up to absurdly easy-to-pull-off theft.\n\nI don't agree with this characterization.

With 0 conf, the timing is far less important (ideally you want to purchase right after a block has been mined, whereas with 1-conf fraud you need to wait and be alerted for a chain conflict and purchase then, which might only happen, what, once a day?) and you have to get lucky that your transaction was mined in one block but not the other (which would be pretty rare unless you're colluding with miners). I'd say 1-conf is the level where there's acceptable but measurable risk. 0-conf has a ton of risk. But of course, that might be low enough for some people in certain situations.

One of the concerns over here at Reddit and other Bitcoin related forums with increasing block-sizes is that it will affect nodecount (i.e., the number of full-nodes). However, I have not seen any actual developer, except perhaps Luke Dash Jr., present that as an argument against increasing block sizes. Most other prominent developers, like Matt Corallo, etc. seem to agree running a full-node doesn't really contribute much to the network and it isn't significant.\n\n2. **Mining centralization**. An extension of the above concern is that raising block-sizes would increase mining centralization. However, that claim is mostly not valid since running a node constitutes a minuscule proportion of the costs related to mining and as such increasing the cost of running a node by even several magnitudes wouldn't start affecting miners unless block-sizes exploded in a very short amount of time. [[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3i2hke/august_23_2015_block_size_and_hard_fork_dialog/cucr9sy/)]\n\n3. **Hard-forks are bad**. Another concern against a simple block-size increase is that it needs a \"hard-fork\" and hard-forks need consensus and consensus is difficult achieve and hard-forks can be dangerous. However, that doesn't seem to be a good argument either, as plenty of other projects have demonstrated that non-contentious hard-forks can be planned and deployed in short amounts of time while being perfectly safe. Also, there have been plenty of incidents where the Bitcoin Core software clients needed emergency upgrades due to bugs and security vulnerabilities ([like this one](https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2014-04-11-heartbleed)) and those were handled with zero fuss. \n\n4. **Blockchains are inefficient**. The best argument (and the only one that I find valid) against raising block-sizes is that it is a terribly inefficient way to scale, which I agree with. Blockchains are indeed extremely inefficient databases compared to a traditional centralized database and therefore scaling on-chain isn't the most efficient option. Increasing block-sizes is just kicking the can down the road, and a more efficient way to scale Bitcoin would be to do it off-chain. While I agree that this is a valid argument for preferring off-chain solutions, I haven't seen any good reason why both can't be done at the same time, especially considering that there is no off-chain solution that will be usable for a long time and not doing so has negative consequences on usability and user-experience.\n\n5. **We need a fee-market**. Another extremely bad argument in favor of limiting block-size is that the artificial cap on block-size can be used to induce a \"fee-market\" (which is basically an auction/bidding-war for block space). The idea is that Bitcoin cannot function without a \"fee-market\" when coin emmisions stop as per schedule (~140 years from now) and the idea is that only high fees can compensate miners in such a situation. However, that is an extremely bad argument because it is trying to solve a problem that doesn't even exist yet (and won't for at least a few decades) and also because there are other factors which determine block rewards for miners including (i)the exchange rate of Bitcoin and (ii)the number of transactions in a block; fees are only one of the variables that determine block reward. Instead of actually solving any problems, this creates a new problem of unsustainably high fees which contributes towards a horrible user-experience and kills any possibility merchant adoption. No one can predict the future and it just seems extremely unwise to solve a problem that won't appear any time soon 20-30 years ahead of time because the assumptions being made now could easily turn out to be wrong and render the \"solution\" useless.\n\n**TL;DR**: There aren't any negatives but it's probably not very efficient.\n\nEdit: Formatting", 7], ["2017-12-25 03:28:16", "And that\u2019s without considering further payment network advances that might improve the situation further.\n\nTalk to me when the block space is fully contenders with 2nd layer settlement transactions and channel setups from new users.

This will free up block space, making fees lower (supply/demand)\n* The block size will probably increase as demand rises. Block size increase effectiveness would be compounded by LN and efficiency upgrades (e.g. segwit) - roughly speaking a 2MB block + LN is equivalent of about a 500MB block size without LN (that's an educated guess, don't quote me as I'm not an expert).\n* opening an LN channel is probably a low-priority transaction that doesn't need to be confirmed quickly, so a lower fee can be used.\n* segwit and other efficiency improvements should reduce average transaction size (and thus fee)\n\nI'd expect channel open/close fees to be lower than $1.

First of all, a lot of people overpay, pay more than they need to. Secondly, the bull market skewed perceptions. People currently apparently don't care about the fees (they think who cares about a $20 fee, I'm $500 richer since yesterday). How can you explain so inefficient usage of the blockchain? Only 10% segwit transactions, many, many services do not batch transactions (instead of sending multi outputs, they send many transactions with change). People don't use replace-by-fee and do child-pays-for parent. It all should cool down, probably the usage could be reduced by 70% with better use. Moreover, in the average fee there are huge transactions with multiple inputs/outputs that are not typical. LN transactions are not large. Due to the segwit magic, LN channel opening and closing transactions are 153 vbytes opening with change (128 without) and  182 vbytes closing with balance going to two parties (149 to one). Right now 140 sat/byte are cleared (and this is still elevated), it gives  $2.5-$3.8 fee for opening or closing the channel at the current, still elevated rates. \n\nMultiple channel openings can go in a single transaction, another channel is only 33 bytes more.

You can buy a $5000 car, pay a $20 fee (still twice as much that is required for virtual certainty of including in the next block but let's play safe) and have it confirmed within the next block. So large transactions are exposed only to the short-term volatility. I would prefer paying $5000 in Bitcoin than LTC because the volatility risk is way smaller. LTC has faster blocks but due to much more frequent orphaning rate, you have to wait for more confirmations.  \n\nSumming up, I agree with you that fees are large and it is hurting adoption.

How can you get defrauded in the latter case? If the person paying you manages to pull off a double spend. The good news is changing the public history of transactions in such a manner \"quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker... if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power.\" How can you get defrauded in the former case? Well, the nature of the LN is such that if one party closes a channel in an old state in an attempt to steal from you, you must act to block the attempted theft by getting your own \"breach remedy transaction\" added to the blockchain within a defined \"dispute period.\" That is a fundamentally different (and weaker) security model. It depends on a user's supposed ability to, when needed, get an on-chain transaction confirmed on the blockchain in a timely manner which is of course exactly what's compromised by imposing an arbitrary constraint on on-chain capacity. It's what I call [the LN's \"fractional-teller banking\" problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4rdkiy/heres_how_bitcoins_lightning_network_could_fail/d50akqm/)  The fundamental problem is that when you move transactions onto a \"second layer,\" you have, by definition, added a layer of risk. And that risk increases the more the main chain is artificially constrained -- the smaller your \"base,\" the more precarious the structures built on top of it. \n\n>But an even simpler way to see why the LN isn't some magical free lunch that eliminates the need for actual (i.e., on-chain) scaling is to consider some basic math. Payment channels require on-chain transactions for their creation. Well, at 3 tx/sec it would take the world's 7 billion people a minimum of about 76 years (!) to each make a single on-chain transaction.\n\nI obviously understand that LN isn't \"banking\" in the sense of traditional fully-custodial banking (i.e., you give the coins to a bank, they put them in their vault to which only they have the key, you get an IOU and you make payments by giving that IOU to a payee / having the bank reassign your IOU to the payee in their master ledger). But LN is also not the \"be your own bank\" of Bitcoin proper (the coins are in your vault to which only you hold the key).  It's a hybrid -- the \"bank\" (hub) doesn't have complete custodial control over the money that's locked up in a channel, but neither do you.\n\n>You didn't really give any reasoning for this.\n\nNo, but neither did you.  \n\n>Hypothetically, assuming LN is running, the block size is 50MB, \n\nWell it sounds like you agree that the block size limit will need to be increased so we may be a lot closer than I initially thought.

LN will use 'watcher nodes' (which you can run yourself) to monitor the network for incorrect (obsolete) transactions. If someone attempts to settle an older version of the channel balance, a penalty transaction can be broadcast automatically to forfeit all their funds in the channel.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that these 'bad actors' can't simply attempt to steal all your money from the channel - they can only attempt to broadcast an earlier balance. Bear in mind that LN transactions would typically be a few dollars, not large amounts.\n\nThe downside is that the network must be monitored for fraud. The upside is that there are incentives for people to provide this as a 3rd party service (e.g. they earn some or all of the penalty amounts), and incentives for individuals to run their own nodes (earn money and take an active role in their own security). This benefits decentralisation.\n\n> the \"bank\" (hub) doesn't have complete custodial control over the money that's locked up in a channel, but neither do you.\n\nThis is incorrect. If you have money in a LN channel you can return it to your 'proper' bitcoin wallet at any time. Simply settle the channel, and the most recent state is committed to the blockchain. No other party can stop you from doing that, ever. The only potential downside is that if you open a channel with a long duration and the other party goes offline, there may be a delay before you can settle the channel.\n\n*No 3rd party has any access to the channel funds.*\n\n>you imagine that the blockchain is handling a small number of low-fee transactions, that implies that the cost of a 51% attack is going to be low.\n\nIf bitcoin scales to mainstream use (via LN + block size increase + segwit, Schnoor, etc.), the blockchain will be handling a *lot* of transactions. Therefore there will be a lot of fees. Fees will be *relatively high* (maybe $1 or 50c) per transaction, as on-block transactions will be for large payments and transfers of wealth rather than cups of coffee. Some people even want higher fees on the blockchain.\n\nCurrently, miners can already make a significant portion of their income from fees. As bitcoin scales, usage could increase by several orders of magnitude. The economies of scale should easily work well for miners - less money per transaction, but up to perhaps tens of millions of those transactions per day.\n\nUsing rough numbers, if bitcoin scaled (with LN and block size increase) to process 2 transactions per person per day (everyone in the world), that's 14billion transactions per day. That should equate to about 1,000,000 transactions per block (based on 133MB block size and 150b/tx using efficiency upgrades)...that's a *lot* more per block than miners are getting now. Those figures are rough approximations based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2110&v=8zVzw912wPo\n\nAlso bear in mind the block rewards will still be significant for the medium term, especially if bitcoin's value continues to rise.

All transactions just have very low fees as of now. :)\n\nWell the question remains then, why even have a fee if all transactions are getting in a block?\n\n> That isn't sustainable.\n\n> Why?\n\nBecause with increase in transaction volume comes increase in blocksize which comes with the increase in resources to run a full node. Currently there's no economic incentive to run a full node, and those that run one run it at a loss. When that loss starts getting more and more substantial as blocks begin to grow, there's going to need to be some sort of income level or node count will drop dramatically. What's to keep those willing to take a substantial loss from monetizing those efforts and charging for access? Talk about KYC/AML points.\n\nThat's not unreasonably out of question either. Craig 'Fake Satoshi' Wright said if you weren't willing to throw down $20k to run a node you can \"fuck off\". $20K is on the minimal end as well, when you take transaction levels on a world scale. At 3.5B people with only 50tx per month, at the median tx size of 226 bytes, you are looking at 8.5GB blocks. And that's only half of the current world population which is expected to grow substantially. To download that in 10 minutes, you are looking at 108 MB/s download speed, which is substantially higher than most people in the first world have access to. Now think about propagation, meaning not only do you have to download, *and validate* that block, but you need to upload it to at least 2 other people to have a network effect. So you don't have 10 minutes. Realistically you have 5 minutes at most, probably closer to 2.5 before orphaning really becomes an issue. We are talking about unfettered access to the full bandwidth of a fiber connection. That is ridiculously expensive. \n\nThen you have to factor in the price of RAM, which is easily the most price restrictive hardware requirement on running a full node. When you factor in the mempool in addition to your very large blocks, all of which are stored in RAM, you are looking at thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of RAM. Not to mention the power requirements to run such a server. \n\n> It works on the same principles as Bitcoin has worked from the start. Doesn't it? Was Bitcoin broken from the start?\n\n*Bitcoin scaling was broken from the start.* the very first response to Satoshi was \"cool idea but it won't scale.\" Just because something works at one scale, doesn't mean it will work at all scales. Do you think Facebook and Google are the exact same architecture they began with? I'd be surprised if even 5% of the original codebase is the same on either as their original code. \n\n> Why hasn't anyone attacked it yet if it is so vulnerable to such attacks? :)\n\nBecause no one gives that much of a shit. Everyone worth their salt knows it's a scam coin and doesn't have the time or desired care to put forth such an effort. But the block limit was put into place for the specific reason of blocking low fee transactions from flooding the network. You need some sort of spam mechanism, and the only fair way to do with without a central authority telling you what is and isn't spam is a fee market.

The opposite argument makes much more sense. Censoring individuals' access to the actual blockchain via an arbitrary and absurdly-tiny capacity limit will force most individuals to make use of risker and more centralized alternatives.  \n\n\n> Are you supposing what, that I trust miners?

If someone attempts to settle an older version of the channel balance, a penalty transaction can be broadcast automatically to forfeit all their funds in the channel.\n> It should also be mentioned that these 'bad actors' can't simply attempt to steal all your money from the channel - they can only attempt to broadcast an earlier balance. Bear in mind that LN transactions would typically be a few dollars, not large amounts.\n> The downside is that the network must be monitored for fraud. The upside is that there are incentives for people to provide this as a 3rd party service (e.g. they earn some or all of the penalty amounts), and incentives for individuals to run their own nodes (earn money and take an active role in their own security). This benefits decentralisation.\n\nThat's all well and good. It might even be made to work reasonably well.  But clearly the LN works less and less well the more the base layer it depends on--the blockchain proper--is artificially constrained. I can't help but notice that you haven't challenged my core thesis.  My core thesis being that second-layer solutions are an imperfect substitute for on-chain transactions.  There's nothing inherently wrong with \"layers.\" There will always be a natural balance between money proper (in Bitcoin's case, on-chain transactions) and various money substitutes (things like the proposed LN or even just simple fully-custodial banking models). The problem with an arbitrary limit on the transactability of the money proper is that it distorts this balance.\n\n>This is incorrect. If you have money in a LN channel you can return it to your 'proper' bitcoin wallet at any time. Simply settle the channel, and the most recent state is committed to the blockchain. No other party can stop you from doing that, ever. The only potential downside is that **if you open a channel with a long duration and the other party goes offline, there may be a delay before you can settle the channel.**\n\nEven if all your channel partner could do is delay your access to your funds, that would still mean that you don't have full custodial control of your money.  \n\n>If bitcoin scales to mainstream use (via LN + block size increase + segwit, Schnoor, etc.), the blockchain will be handling a lot of transactions. Therefore there will be a lot of fees. Fees will be relatively high (maybe $1 or 50c) per transaction, as on-block transactions will be for large payments and transfers of wealth rather than cups of coffee. Some people even want higher fees on the blockchain.\n\nI agree that the only model that works for Bitcoin's future security is one in which the blockchain is handling a lot of transactions.  But I don't know that fees will or should be \"relatively high.\" Transactional friction is cancer for money or anything that, like Bitcoin, aspires to become money -- because literally the entire purpose of money is to *reduce* transactional friction.\n", 4], ["2017-12-11 02:56:19", "Do you know if watcher nodes are already implemented?

Craig 'Fake Satoshi' Wright said if you weren't willing to throw down $20k to run a node you can \"fuck off\". $20K is on the minimal end as well, when you take transaction levels on a world scale. At 3.5B people with only 50tx per month, at the median tx size of 226 bytes, you are looking at 8.5GB blocks.

Negligible risks are introduced, but with the benefit of using money in a much better way than a blockchain could ever handle.\n\n>an arbitrary limit on the transactability of the money proper is that it distorts this balance.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this.

It is not in a merchant's best interests to cause such a delay - they would be delaying their own access to the funds, and they would be providing poor customer service.

A mild inconvenience in exchange for lower fees and faster transactions.\n\n\n> I don't know that fees will or should be \"relatively high.\" \n\nBy 'relatively high' I mean compared to the near-free cost of LN transactions. I mean paying an amount per byte, which is dumb, and makes very small payments impractical (even fees of a couple of cents for every transaction are unacceptable to me, as they add up, and cut out the poor, and prevent cool uses like paying tiny amounts for reading a blog post or watching a Youtube video.\n\nMiners stand to make huge amounts of money form the volume even if fees are a few cents. Higher fees wouldn't be a big concern because most people would make few on-chain transactions, and those would generally be for large enough amounts that even a fee as high as a dollar would be a negligible cost (e.g. buying a TV for $500 + $1 fee). An equilibrium will be found.\n\n> the entire purpose of money is to reduce transactional friction.\n\nThat is the exact purpose of lightning network. It was designed for near-instant, near-zero-fee transactions allowing people who can't afford to pay fees per byte to use bitcoin, allowing fractions of cents payments to content creators, enabling salaries to be paid daily or hourly, allowing for streaming money.\n\nBlockchain (by itself) doesn't have those benefits. It's slow, has a dumb fee structure, and doesn't enable small payments.\n\nI personally want the best of both worlds - the blockchain to provide safety and self control of my money, and services and technologies running on top of that to make my day-to-day life more convenient, and to increase the possibilities of what myself (and the world) can do with money. I can still 'run my own bank' by keeping my bitcoin safe in hardware wallets, and I can accept some tiny tradeoffs for making my regular daily use of money simple by putting day-to-day funds in LN channels.\n\nWith LN keeping block size down, I have the option to run a full node without spending big on hardware, storage, and bandwidth.

Instead, Google and Amazon offer node access for $5 per month. Why would you pay $20K for a node when you could get access for $5 per month? That's 333 years worth of node access and you don't have to deal with the hassle of the hardware. Now even less people have a node. The free access ones are overwhelmed or disappear entirely (why would you offer free service is people are willing to pay?). Blocks get even bigger because why not... and you don't have a node to combat that.

Here's a summary of how Bitcoin's market governance actually works:\n\nMiners deploy their hash rate to create one or more candidate chains, but it's investors more broadly who must ultimately give value to those chains and thereby provide the continuing incentive for the deployment of that hash rate.  Miners are thus incentivized to (and ultimately must) \"follow the market,\" which includes attempting to *anticipate* what chain (or chains) with what features investors will value most highly. But it's *also* true that investors are incentivized to \"follow the miners.\" The most-PoW chain not only offers the most security but it's also a very powerful Schelling point for the market to converge on.\n\nBut a key point for purposes of the present conversation is that miners move first. It's up to them to determine which chain (or chains) to create / allow to live.  \n\nIn other words, it's the *market / investors* that incentivize miners to create one or more chains that follow certain rules. Some economic actors have more influence than others (and some of them may happen run to \"full nodes\"). But it's their status as important economic actors that's important. It's absolutely NOT that *nodes qua nodes* have much (if any) influence. You could modify your own \"full node\" to begin rejecting any blocks larger than 300 kb. And guess what would happen? Your \"full node\" would grind to a halt and *no one would give a shit*.\n\nHere are two other comments ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7e06jm/big_blocks_how_far_can_we_take_it/dq2boad/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7hqdck/craig_wright_dont_run_a_node_to_help_the_network/dqt0isj/)) that explain why the small-blocker fetishization of so-called \"full nodes\" is so misguided.", 2], ["2017-12-11 22:13:22", "> As is the blockchain (slow, unsuitable for very small payments).\n\nRight, the Bitcoin blockchain is currently artificially constrained as a result of the continued imposition of the 1-MB limit on the base block size.

The imposition of an arbitrary limit on the capacity of the base layer (currently taking the form of the 1-MB limit on base block size / 4 million \"weight\" limit) necessarily shifts and distorts the balance between money proper (on-chain payments) and money substitutes.  Obviously if the block size limit were soft forked *down* to 1-kb the entire system would grind to a halt.

Since Bitcoin has already survived a long period with ~1% orphan rate, I'm assuming that a 1% orphan rate isn't a problem. \n\nConsidering the last date for with data is available on propagation times for at Bitcoinstats ([05/04/2017](http://bitcoinstats.com/network/propagation/2017/04/05)) - the average propagation times for blocks reaching 50% of all nodes was 1.818s. For propagation times of 1.818s you get an expected orphan rate of [0.30%](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+exp\\(-1.818%2F600\\)\\)+in+%25), which seems to fit well enough with available data regarding orphan rates at that time.\n\nIf we assume 1% to be an appropriate orphan rate, we can have avg. block propagation times of around [6.03s](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+-+exp\\(-6.03%2F600\\)\\)+in+%25). Since block propagation times increase linearly with block-sizes (other variables remaining constant), Bitcoin could have handled at least 3.19 MB (= 0.96 * 6.03/1.82) in April, 2017 without increasing orphan rates beyond 1%. If we follow Nielsen's Law, we could double that size every 2 years without it affecting orphan rates. (Additionaly, other improvements, such as BIP-152 and tools like Matt Corallo's FIBRE has meant that orphan blocks are extremely rare now, so I think that a high orphan rate should not be a concern in short-term or mid-term future of Bitcoin even if block-sizes were to rise several times.)\n\nYou may also find [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3i2hke/august_23_2015_block_size_and_hard_fork_dialog/cucr9sy/) interesting.\n\nEdit: formatting and spelling corrections", 1], ["2017-12-24 19:22:12", "Block propagation time has decreased because Bitcoin was ridiculously undeveloped, and the core developers have done a fantastic job of picking all the low-hanging fruit when it comes to latency improvements.\n\nTo expect the same rate of improvement to continue seems dangerously optimistic.", 1], ["2017-12-24 19:50:22", "I'm not even assuming the same rate of improvement. \n\nIf one agrees that a 1% chance of orphaning is acceptable, then the numbers suggest Bitcoin should be able to do *at least* 3.19 MB *now* without causing any mining centralization, even if there were absolutely no further improvements to the Bitcoin Core client.\n\nImprovements in internet bandwidth, which have been observed to follow Nielsen's Law, will continue to happen independent of improvements in client software.\n\nI also linked another post from a small miner, which says that they do not have see a problem with larger blocks and that bandwidth contributes to a minuscule amount of their operating costs, and even if they had to upgrade their internet connection, it wouldn't be a significant problem.\n\nThis is why I was saying earlier that it is important to first define the metrics one is going to use to reach a conclusion regarding how block sizes affect mining centralization.

They'd last for at least 2 to 3 years (being conservative), and by then bandwidth would have improved enough to be able to have even larger blocks, and by then, hopefully, one would also have actual usable off-chain scaling alternatives like LN or sidechains available for use.\n\n> Going from 8 to 16tx/s is utterly negligible if we're looking to become a payment network.\n\nWell, I don't get this line of argument at all.\n\nYou have to go from 4tps to 16tps one way or the other, and no matter how you do it, it's going to be gradual (speaking of actual throughput, not throughput capacity). The idea is to keep the capacity limit ahead of the curve (i.e., keep capacity more than actual demand for transaction throughput). It's just the better thing to do from a design and user-experience point of view. So, if the demand is at 4tps now, try to keep the limit above that. If it is 8tps a couple of years later, try to keep the limit above that then. Sure, it's very very good to plan for and build a system that will potentially give you 400tps, but it'll just end up staying unused until there's enough demand for it; it's better to solve the immediate problems now. \n\n> So when you ask if a 1% orphan rate is acceptable, I'm thinking \"well, it's not catastrophic, but it's definitely not worth such a trivial increase in throughput\".\n\nBut it wouldn't be a trivial increase at all.

Scaling means enabling fast *growth*, not postulating some weird, rather impossible scenario.\n\nFor a more realistic plan, let us go back to mid 2016, before blocks were full and the limit took effect:\n\nWe have been growing almost linear at a rate of about 200kb per year, or 100mb per 500 years. What do we do? Maybe we can try to *accelerate growth* by merchant adoption and usability improvements? Maybe we can even *double* the growth rate in a few years time? Maybe we are lucky and some big players step in and we quickly *quadruple* the growth rate to 100mb per 125 years? Or should we stop growth here to introduce a transaction auction where transaction only go through if you outbid others?\n\nThe idea of a growth rate that outpaces technology improvements (in hardware *and* software) is a luxury problem and a wet dream, but unfortunately not yet in sight.\n\nNow a less unreasonable argument against on-chain scaling is that larger blocks would harm decentralization. This seems incorrect. The idea hinges on two distinct but often conflated arguments that I will treat separately:\n\n**1. Larger blocks lead to less nodes**\n\nNobody can predict the future but the opposite is much more likely. If we were to grow say 20x, with a respectable 40tx/sec we would be a notable player in the payment industry. There would likely be 100,000s of businesses, analysts, statisticians, financial institutions, developers, enthusiasts and freaks that would be eager scrutinize the blockchain, *even if this would take some serious hardware investment*.\n\nThe cost of 10 terabytes of storage plus additional resource costs, is orders of magnitudes smaller than the value of 10tb worth of blockchain data.\n\n**2. For Bitcoin to be decentralized, every user must be able to cheaply run a full node**\n\nI am not sure who came up with this requirement, but frankly it is rather silly. Not only does the idea of end-users running full nodes lacks a sense of realism, it also lacks understanding of how Bitcoin works.\n\nBitcoin uses a structure called a *merkle tree*, which allows anybody to verify the proof-of-work and a subset of the transactions. This means I can verify my own transactions without verifying yours. The decision for me not to verify your transactions *only* affects me. *It does not affect you, anybody else or the network in any way*. The idea that this somehow affects decentralization appeals to intuition, but not to reason.\n\nWhat surprises me the most about this argument 2 (and certainly it is often repeated), is not just that people believe this. What surprises me even more is that people who believe that Bitcoin works that way actually get into Bitcoin. To me it seems, that a cryptocurrency where end-users verify all transactions in the world would be utterly unscalable.", 9], ["2017-12-06 17:46:17", "I'm a \"small blocker\" and even I realise that it will be necesarry to increase the blocksize eventually.

But eventually network bandwidth and latency will be low enough that increasing it will become less of an issue. The issue then becomes how to reach network consensus on the new rules.", 3], ["2017-12-07 04:24:01", "> I think it is pretty clear that a blocksize increase can't be a solution to the scaling problem.\n\nIt might not be your preferred solution, but it is a solution.  You can hope transaction volume grows slower than consumer hardware, or you can buy an expensive server, or you can use SPV.  It is a security-usability tradeoff.  Every software and every user must make security-usability tradeoffs.  There is no need to be dramatic about it.  \n\nFor example, AFAIK, excluding all the shitcoins, BTC is the middle of the road, not the most secure.  BTC involves highly unnecessary third-party trust because miners can soft-fork to censor your coins indefinitely - and they may have no choice if the government asks them.  Your raspberry pi fullnode can do nothing about it.  If I actually want security, I will use XMR and not either bitcoin.\n\nAdditionally, some amount of block size increase seems likely to be necessary eventually if adoption continues to grow, even if LN works perfectly and everyone uses it.  Most of Core do not dispute this [idea](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0103.mediawiki), as evidenced by Segwit including a block size increase to 2MB / worst-case 4MB.  However, further increases require a HF, and Core seemingly can never agree on a HF.\n\n> On /r/btc it seems like they despise the notion of a blockchain as a settlement layer in order to scale, which implies that they think that they already found the solution (with bigger blocks).\n\n/r/btc, like most cryptocurrency forums, is fairly weird.  People posting anti-off-chain propaganda all day in /r/btc may not represent the majority of users, developers, or miners.  Personally, my theory is that anti-SF-segwit rhetoric, which originated from miners who opposed it for economic reasons, developers who opposed it for other reasons, and developers who opposed it for the economic reason that they were paid by miners, became a meme out of their control which evolved into anti-off-chain scaling in general.\n\nSince it's difficult to speak for the majority of BCC users in a Sybil-proof manner, we can instead look at the attitudes of big-block developers, and the miners who fund them.  This is especially interesting since miners have a direct economic interest to fund development of a coin that their users actually want.  \n\nBCC developers specifically avoided SF-segwit.  There are other methods of fixing malleability, but they are not considered a priority to implement.  (This is not surprising seeing as for now they lack real-world applications.)\n\nIncentive-wise, I suspect the reason there was a lot of opposition to SF-segwit from miners was because of the following impacts:\n\n* Because it is a soft fork, the witness discount is the only way to provide a block size increase.  It provides an explicit economic incentive for users to transact off-chain, even in use cases where they might ordinarily choose on-chain if there was a simple block size increase with no witness discount.  Obviously this is bad for fee revenue.\n* SF-segwit interferes with covert ASICBOOST.  Bitmain claims to hold a purely defensive patent for ASICBOOST, but it is not unreasonable to assume they may profit from it now or in the future.\n\nFrom the witness discount alone, especially because there is an obvious hard-fork alternative, a chain split already seems like the natural result to me.  If you changed the emission curve a bit (even though the current one is poorly designed for use as a global currency in every objective economic sense), hodlers would feel scammed and fork the chain.  This is probably exactly how miners felt about the witness discount.  Actually, I think it's worse for them, because their mining equipments are illiquid compared to the bitcoins they mine, so they are stuck with the consequences for longer whether they like it or not.\n\nIf there was no ability to fork the chain, I think there would be significant harm done by messing with mining incentives.  You might say that bitcoin exists to serve only the users, not the miners.  But setting a precedent to arbitrarily change the rules in a way that screws miners discourages future entry into the already difficult-to-enter ASIC business.  Is it better if nobody ever wants to challenge Bitmain?  (But this is hypothetical.  As it is I don't see the witness discount as harmful, specifically because anyone is free to use BCC for on-chain transactions.)\n\nAnyway, as for other malleability fixes: new use cases such as off-chain micropayments, atomic swaps, etc. would increase mining fee revenue.  Additionally, suppose LN works on a large scale as advertised and becomes widely used at some point (we can be optimistic, but it is not 100% guaranteed).  BCC would presumably suffer greatly if it does not support LN by then, because all currencies that support AS via LN would benefit from a network effect with each other.  If BCC were to support LN, the fees lost from more efficient use of transactions might be negligible compared to the revenue gained from the price of BCC being higher.\n\nEven if we use the approximation that BCC development is 100% controlled by the Evil Miners led by Chief Evil Miner Jihan Wu, it seems unlikely to me that there will never be off-chain scaling, if and when off-chain scaling proves its usefulness in production.

The higher the limit is, the further into the future you have to go to encounter this scaling \"problem\". And to keep it high is the most risk averse way to deal with the issue.\n\nThe idea is, let there be an invisible/high limit (like there was in the first 7 years of Bitcoin) to let the network *prosper naturally*. Meanwhile, keep working on finding other ways to scale the network and start using them when they are *ready* and *economically viable*. If they are ready and they make sense, people will use them automatically.\n\nLayer-2 solutions are not ready or economically viable yet, and keeping an arbitrary block size limit on account of them does not let the network prosper naturally.

Here's something I wrote on this point:\n\nLong before Bitcoin Cash became a thing, we heard small-blockers claim that upgrading the network via a (hash power-majority) hard fork was dangerous because it risked splitting the chain whereas a (hash power-majority) soft fork would supposedly avoid this risk.\n\nBitcoin Cash definitively demonstrates how ridiculous this position was. The catalysts for Bitcoin Cash and the accompanying chain split were (a) the hash power majority's decision to push through a controversial soft fork (SegWit) -- necessitating a counter fork by those who didn't want to be swept along and (b) the hash power majority's mind-boggling, multi-year *failure* to timely implement an obviously-needed hard fork in the form of a block size increase. I also think Bitcoin Cash is demonstrating, and will continue to demonstrate, that \"chain splits\" are not a \"danger\" that needs to be feared. They're a healthy mechanism by which the market can discover and express its will in the case of serious controversy. \n\n>And ironically for the bitcoin cash guys, they wanted to keep bitcoin useful, but they ended up with a coin that's really inferior to a lot of alts.\n\nI don't think it's meaningfully inferior to any alts.  It's certainly an underdog relative to the dominant Bitcoin chain by virtue of the fact that it forked off as a minority hash rate spinoff, forfeited the standalone \"Bitcoin\" identity, and made wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and difficulty adjustment algorithm. As I wrote before:\n\nBTC has a currently larger network effect but a currently worse protocol when compared to BCH. BTC's network effect is larger because it has more exchange, wallet, and ecosystem support, greater \"brand\" recognition, and a market cap that's still substantially higher than BCH's.  Those are significant advantages. *But* the BTC chain is in the process of shooting itself in the foot by failing to increase its transactional capacity to accommodate rising adoption, despite the fact that this is leading to outrageous fees and slow and unreliable confirmations and an all-around *terrible* user experience. (Seriously, my experience as a user of Bitcoin was *much* better 5 years ago than it is now when it should be the exact opposite.)  The real question is whether BTC will be able to improve its protocol faster than BCH can improve its network effect. The most conservative play as an investor is to simply hold both, but you may also want to consider rebalancing your portfolio to weight one or the other more heavily based on which scenario you see as more likely.\n\nAlso, this is a really great article from Daniel Krawisz that I think puts the Bitcoin Cash fork in appropriate context: [How to Face Bitcoin Forks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GY1A9R13_iNJn4Fai43C6qXnHgqNNWn-09Eqq3Ps0f0/edit)\n\n>Lose lose for everyone in my opinion.\n\nI disagree.

As such anyone with nontrivial hashpower may reasonably attempt a hashpower-based double-spending attack.\n\n51% block withholding does not mean breaking even pre-double-spends.  It asymptotically doubles your gross mining revenue, which must naturally mean a huge increase in margins.  You make half of all mining revenue, or more than $18,000,000 per day, completely for free (even assuming BTC is $10k, BCC does not exist, and fees are small).  \n\nWith less than 50%, [selfish-mining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0243.pdf) is not only possible, but profitable in theory, without even trying to double-spend.

I'm positive you are still misunderstanding something.  Let's break it down into more detail (ignoring fees for now since its not important for this example, and will only over-complicate things...)\n\n    A\n    |\n    B - C\n    |\n    D\n\nThe nodes (shown by capital letters) are named: N^A, N^B, N^C, and N^D.  The channels (shown by the lines between nodes) are named C^AB, C^BC, and C^BD.\n\nLet's say that N^A wants to send 1btc to N^C.  In order to do this, N^A must own at least 1btc in C^AB, and N^B must own at least 1btc in C^BC.  Let's assume there is exactly that amount in both channels.\n\nWhen the transaction is sent on LN, each node in the path must agree to the transaction. Specifically N^B checks to make sure that he can receive 1btc from N^A and can send 1btc to N^C.  The money is ready to go in the channels, so several contracts are exchanged to set up the transfer, and using prehash commitments to make sure no one can cheat, this happens in this order:\n\n1 - The 1btc owned by N^B in C^BC becomes owned by N^C.  N^C has now been paid by N^B.\n2 - The 1btc owned by N^A in C^AB becomes owned by N^B.  N^B has now been paid by N^A.\n\nYou can see that N^A has spent the 1btc, and N^C has received 1btc, and N^B owns the same amount, although now N^B owns 1btc in C^AB (instead of in C^BC).\n\nNow lets look at your double-spend scenario.  We're assuming that N^D knows nothing about the above transaction, and that N^B has at least 1btc in C^BD.  What if N^A tries to pay 1btc to N^D, without having the money to do so because it has already been sent to N^C?\n\nWell, just like before, each node in the path must agree to the transaction.  If N^B is honest, N^B will say \"hey, this doesn't work, because N^A doesn't control any more btc in C^AB to send me.  So the transaction won't happen because a path is found.\n\nWell, what if N^B is dishonest, or is just controlled by the same person who controls N^A?  Sure, then N^B agrees, and contracts are exchanged.  Secretly, N^A and N^B don't do the arrangements for C^AB, and N^D doesn't know about this.\n\nThis is actually still no problem.  Here's what will happen:\n\n1. Just like the above transaction: The 1btc owned by N^B in C^BD becomes owned by N^D.  N^D has now been paid by N^B.\n2. N^B is supposed to receive 1btc from N^A via C^AB, but he can't, because N^A didn't have the funds there to send...so...nothing happens.\n\nThe end result is that N^B has just paid N^D instead of N^A.  That's it.\n\nSo, even if a single party controls both N^A and N^B, the only thing they can accomplish by lying to the network is stealing/giving btc to and from their own two nodes.", 1], ["2018-01-11 23:56:36", "So, if you have only one channel open with someone with, say 0.1 BTC and someone else wants to send you 0.2 BTC, then that transaction will never be possible through the Lightning Network?", 1], ["2018-01-12 02:34:29", "Okay, in that case I seem to have been wrong.

The next release of bitcoin core should hopefully propel the adoption and we might see more exchanges starting to support it, which would be huge. \n\nAnd then we have Schnorr signatures coming soon in the future which will not only help reduce the size of transactions, but it will also improve privacy and help reduce SPAM on the network, which many have speculated has been at least a partial cause of the current transaction fees.\n\nAnd then we have lightning network, which (I hope) will almost entirely solve the scaling issue, and which also brings so many cool possibilities, including atomic swaps. \n\nI really feel that once we have all of this stuff in place, bitcoin will really be more fit as a currency than the bitcoin cash alternative. Yeah, I wish we did have bigger blocks right now... I don't buy that just increasing the size by a factor of 2 would have any significant centralizing effect on nodes.

Amazon would bring crypto to light in a brand new way and it would be astounding. \n\nIn reference to the lightning network you may have it backwards.

It's bad to take a loan in them because deflation is like interest only worse in this case.  The great depression was the result of deflation not hyperinflation.\n\nBTC becoming a currency is difficult to impossible with the stability it lacks and the volatility inherent to a deflationary asset that has a relatively few people and $ involved but is adding to that number significantly everyday.  Until the new players stop coming in it will be very difficult to stabilize the price.\n\nCome to think of it this is another thing that bothers me about bitconnect.  I know little of how it works, but who in their right mind is going to borrow BTC?  The only people that might be willing to do that are idiots or those that believe the price is going to crash...\n\nBut I digress.  Your other concerns are valid.  I myself hope to one day see near zero fees, it's the only way the poorest 50% of the planet will be able to transact in it regularly.  I hope to see faster transactions that don't favor the rich or those willing to pay more.  That being said I'm happy with it as a store of value albeit volatile, and I believe that one day these problems will be solved and it will stabilize enough to resemble a currency.  I don't know that I'll be alive to see that day.\n\nI'd also wager there's a chance that it would fade away, probably only from the number one spot, and be replaced by something better but don't believe this is an overnight scenario.  I think whatever does that will have to be heads and shoulders above BTC because the first mover advantage here is HUGE. There's also the fact that BTC isn't sitting idly by.  It is making improvements.  No they're not fast enough for some but I don't want to see improvements at the expense of decentralization.", 3], ["2017-11-22 07:11:47", "For me there is an inverse co-relation between the value of fiat and the value of Bitcoin.\n\nI don't think Bitcoin will become a true currency until people really being to see through the fallacy of fiat, and that probably won't happen until there is a systemic crisis in the banking system.\n\nFor me, the true worth of Bitcoin is that breaks the chains between the individual and the corporatist state. I am not a Libertarian. I see value in the State and the Public Realm, but not in the State using the value of people's labour for political gain.\n\nUltimately, that system will unravel. Only so much fiat can be pumped into the system before people realise that its all a mirage. I promote Bitcoin to further that end, and hold so that I'm in the lifeboat when the ship inevitably goes down.", 2], ["2017-11-23 03:48:47", "If you had gotten into bitcoin in 2010, you would have found bitcoin was basically unusable. That's because it was new technology. But a lot of people saw promise in it. The thing is, bitcoin is still new technology. Its not finished by a long shot. And yet tons of people are using it. In fact so many people are using it that the technology is being strained. The result is that fees have gone up.\n\nBitcoin is currently a useful currency for transmitting larger amounts of money safely and quickly. Sure its not competitive for buying coffee at the moment, but its great for sending $400 to someone in another country. There's a $500 billion remittance market (the amount of wire-transfers and such that happen every year), and bitcoin does that better than anything out there. Its usefulness as that makes it valuable, and its fixed supply, its requirement of supermajority support for protocol changes, and its track record of carefully erring on the side of long term security makes it a great store of value - since those things should ensure a very stable and predictable protocol policy going forward. \n\nIn the near future, efficiency improvements like Schnorr Signatures will improve on-chain transaction throughput and as a consequence lower fees. Segwit adoption will also continue to happen slowly, also lowering fees. An improvement of 20-40% efficiency of something like Schnorr Signature sure won't get us 1000x scaling, but they're still very valuable and impressive technical improvements. Every little bit helps. But the Lightning Network is where things get really exciting. \n\nSince in the lightning network, transaction processing is truly distributed, the number of transactions per second such a network can process is nearly unlimited. Where in bitcoin, every node processes every transaction, in the Lightning Network, only 2-10 nodes process any given transaction. The limit is instead related to how often people open and close Lightning channels. Imagine a future where everyone used the Lightning Network (LN). You'd be paid via the Lightning Network, you'd buy groceries with the LN, you'd pay bills via the LN. There would be little reason to ever close your lightning channels. Additional proposals around channel groups could make the Lightning Network easier to handle too: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bzn0k/lightning_network_has_just_been_bumped_to_layer_3/\n\nSo let's say that on average, people opened, closed, or recharged 1 lightning channel every 6 months. With 100% segwit adoption, we'll probably see around 5 transactions/second. So with a little bit of math, we can figure out that about 78.8 million users can be supported in this situation. If everyone's doing 20 transactions per month, that's almost 1.6 billion transactions / month or over 600 tps. That's scaling of 30,000%! \n\nPeople are imagining tho that instead of doing 20 transactions per month, people will be doing 2000 or more. Since in the Lightning Network, a normal transaction never hits the blockchain, there is really no limitation. A single user could send 10 transactions per second and there would be no problem. You will see people experimenting with \"streaming money\" where you pay for services per second of use. \n\nBut certainly even with 30,000% scaling, you're only serving about 80 million users, whereas we need to serve 100 times more than that (the world of 8 billion people at that point). This is where efficiency improvements like Schnorr Signatures and other future improvements will be so valuable. Without compressing on-chain transactions further, the LN can support the world only with 100MB blocks. But with Schnorr Signatures, that number becomes 60MB. With additional scaling that number could easily become 40 or even 30MB. This is a size that I believe not even most informed big-blockers think is likely safe today, but in 10 or 20 years, it very well may be. \n\nBitcoin is still in its early years. In the next year or two, we'll see the lightning network come out and take the world by storm. In 3-4 years, we'll see real mass adoption where people are really buying coffee with bitcoin every day. In 10 years, we'll see major fiat currencies start to die out, but it won't affect the economy much because everyone has started using bitcoin. \n\nSo keep your seatbelt on. The whiplashening is coming. ", 2], ["2017-11-26 16:34:11", ">is that a good thing, isn\u2019t that just PayPal for bitcoin, I thought bitcoin was all about the blockchain and the safety in that. \n\nThe problem is that blockchains don't scale.\n\n[The very first reply to Satoshi mentions the problem:](https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09963.html)\n\n> To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.\n\nYes, the blockchain is safer and decentralized.  It also consumes so much bandwidth that it will be too expensive to keep it both decentralized and secure and serve billions of transactions per day.\n\nThe trick is not to increase block sizes (which sacrifices decentralization, which sacrifices all properties of Bitcoin), the trick is to aggregate multiple transactions into a single blockchain transaction, and thus applying the properties of the aggregated blockchain transaction to the transactions making it up.  That's what higher layers do, in the end.\n\n----\n\nNow you might say, can't we increase block sizes and leave most users as SPV?  [I have an answer to that too](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bsd90/why_we_do_not_bigblock/dq9jmpj/).  In summary: widespread SPV ***is a centralization event***, with miners and (the remaining few) fullnodes controlling all rules of Bitcoin.  This includes rules like the currency issuance schedule and the coinbase maturity rule.\n\nIn such a case, there would be no point to using Bitcoin over fiat currencies: it would be the same old regime, with the people in charge of creating new coins being the ones who control when additional coins get issued.\n\n-----\n\nThe only way out is to leave the blockchain layer decentralized, meaning it should be easy for a new fullnode to be set up, and to discourage existing fullnodes from shutting down due to lack of resources.  Meaning: small blocks.\n\nThen upper layers can build on the blockchain.  As upper layers cannot change currency issuance, centralization of the upper layers is less of a concern than centralization of the blockchain layer.\n\n-----\n\nNow there is the common accusation that LN will centralized around one or two hubs globally, becoming just PayPal 2.0.  But that is not true.\n\nAs long as the base blockchain layer is decentralized and permissionless, it would be possible for anyone to create a channel with anyone other than The Hub.  And that channel is now an alternative route that The Hub does not control and cannot monitor.  Yes, channels have on-ramp and off-ramp costs.  But you can open a channel and keep it open forever.  If it contains funds for you then you can use those funds on-Lightning for spending, so there is no reason for you to close it.  If it contains no funds for you, then nobody can steal those funds (you don't have funds on the channel to steal) and still there is no reason for you to close it.\n\nAnd anyone who gathers enough money together can make dozens of channels, serving as an alternative route for others to use.  Millions of people can do that, and in aggregate they can be enough to be a credible competitor, an alternative, to The Hub.\n\nThat means that The Hub cannot keep its monopoly over serving transactions.\n\nThis is unlike PayPal, where you must be on PayPal to pay others on PayPal.  On Lightning, it does not matter whether you have or do not have a channel to The Hub.  All you need is a route, direct or indirect, to your payee.  And it does not matter *who* is on that route.\n\nThere is no trust needed, The Hub cannot prevent you from transacting, and nobody can steal your money from you.\n\n\n----\n\nEDIT: [Another relevant LN post by me about why people continue to think that LN is centralized and permissioned, I should probably put them on a website at this point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7emgwg/are_there_serious_competitors_for_2l_solutions/dq6f5cx/)", 1], ["2017-11-27 09:36:36", "Greed has always been here, but in the early days there were definitely more libertarians who were a bit more positive since they focused on the freedom aspect instead of the price.

A distributed computer system without a central hub is \"decentralized\" even with 3 nodes, but I don't think that's anyone's goal.\n\nOn the other hand, \"decentralized\" begins to have marginal returns and can be restrictive to practical access. We could dial back the block weight to handle 512 byte blocks, and I can hook up a dial up modem to my smart refrigerator and turn it into a hub, and we could be *even more decentralized*. But I don't think 512 byte blocks would be good either.\n\nThe fact is, block size is directly correlated to \"decentralization\", and any increase will bring *some level* of centralization. Anyone arguing that isn't worth wasting your time on, because the question isn't \"will it bring centralization?\" its \"are we ok with the level of centralization this brings?\" I think we are all ok not having our smart TVs running nodes.\n\nSo with that said, \"decentralization\" in my mind means anyone having access to a fully validating node, using reasonable hardware. And when I say \"reasonable hardware\", I mean, reasonable for the rest of the world, not just western societies where quasi super computers are commonplace in a 14 year old's room. I'm talking reasonable for the people who depend on their Nokia 1000 phones. The people without banks, and without a stable currency. That's who bitcoin is actually for imo. They are who will benefit the most from it.\n\nBut that still isn't explicit enough, so I propose an idea of a target base level hardware to have... \"minimum requirements\" if you will... And to me, a good starting point is the RPi. I say this because the RPi has been designed with the rest of the world in mind. It is supposed to be the most accessible computer in the world. As an alternative, if there was some way of putting measurable hardware levels on a bell curve, I would say anything past the bottom 2nd deviation from the median level of consumer hardware is the bottom limit. 2 standard deviations is a fairly common measure of \"normal\" activity.\n\nI also believe, that with the demand for more block space, we will see dedicated validation hardware/infrastructure being developed. Having run a full node on a full desktop, I can tell you, RAM is by far the biggest issue, and a RPi has little of it, and has no plans to increase it. Possibly SSDs and a more efficient method of storing UTXOs will offer a solution. Possibly a device, dedicated for being the most cost effective way of running a full node, accessible to everyone and possibly open source designed could be developed and bypass the more general limitations of the RPi.\n\nBandwidth is also a huge issue, but with the coming of 5G in the near future, I believe that won't be even an issue in the coming decade.\n\nMy least concern is storage. Obviously full copies of the blockchain are great, but public libraries could easily carry a copy. You know some hardcore geeks have it printed out somewhere. There's always going to be someone who could audit it, so pruning and auditable checkpoints become commonplace. No real need for most to store the entire chain imo.\n\nI would rather be conservative at this stage rather than set a precedent for growing block sizes. We can always increase the block size if for some reason it is causing an issue, but the more we increase the block size, the less nodes we have fighting for a smaller block size. Google/Microsoft/Facebook/Amazon would love nothing more than to be the \"Bitcoin Service Providers\" of the future and the less amount of resistance they run in with consensus the easier that becomes for them. BCH proponents claim $20K nodes, but Google could offer $5/month node service and someone could pay for 333 years worth of service instead of buying/maintaining a node. That's a no brainer. At that point, 1TB blocks become a \"why not\" question, because the big players can handle it, and the small players can't, and \"think of all the room\". Permissioned access and KYC/AML at your node service provider. Everything we don't want. Its very hard to reverse from this. We can always increase from too small though.", 19], ["2017-11-28 03:22:37", "I think people look at increases in block size (or weight) the wrong way.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about how bigger blocks will increase centralization and part of the counter argument is that even if some percentage of nodes are forced to drop out of the network then you're still left with a large (but slightly smaller) decentralized community.\n\nThis looks at the broad community, but ignores how Bitcoin is designed to be used _by individuals_. You're supposed to run your own full node, have your own copy of the ledger and validate your own transactions. That is how you trustlessly use Bitcoin. That is how you be your own bank. In any other configuration you rely on trust from at least one other party.\n\nSo the problem is not that we will go from 100k nodes to 80k nodes if we increase blocks by X. That doesn't seem like a huge deal. The problem is by doing that you remove 20k people's ability to use Bitcoin trustlessly, and that's a huge problem.", 6], ["2017-11-28 06:08:13", "Something else to take into account here, is that most people who casually run a node probably don't want the node using up ALL of their computing resources, bandwidth, and storage.

People can easily set up a rasberry pi to run a node, but who is going to buy a new gaming PC just to turn it into a node and suck up all of their bandwidth so that they cant even watch Netflix anymore?\n\nBut with that said, the storage problem at least would be solved by running a pruned node. Is there any real reason why the average person shouldn't just run a pruned node and leave the real full nodes to organizations? That shouldn't really degrade security at all, should it? Does running a pruned node also lighten the resources in any other areas like ram usage or bandwidth?", 6], ["2017-11-28 10:06:30", "> * Blockchain storage,\n> * Average bandwidth,\n> * Traffic per day, and\n> * RAM usage\n\nThere's at least one cost missing: The cost of transacting.

Deflation isn't magic and doesn't exist in a bubble. Deflation simply does not exist outside a functioning economy. The growth you're seeing right now is not deflation, at all, no one knows the *real value* of Bitcoin yet, and by that I mean its settling value. We will get there eventually, but we have to understand what Bitcoin is and how it's used for the market to sort that out. The rise in price reflects is value the market is attributing to it, but that value is almost completely speculative on it's future utility. Hodlers and speculators at large agree and believe that the utility of Bitcoin will be massive in the future, that lends to its price today AND as more and more people are educated about Bitcoin, more people want it, demand increases, and the price goes up. This isn't deflation though, this is just price discovery and everyone (read: *lots of us*) agrees that its resting value will be far higher than it is today, so everyone who is in the know is buying as much as they can. This is precisely why Bitcoin and it's valuation is (probably) not at all a bubble. If some devastating bug were found in the code rendering the system useless, or if some other currency replaced it entirely and rendered it completely obsolete (hypothetically), then we could safely say it was a \"bubble\", but pending some disastrous unforeseen problem like this its real-world utility is almost boundless so everyone who is educated on it is willing to pour money into it. Again, I reiterate, this is not a deflationary force.\n\n\n> Wouldn't Joe be reluctant to pay x amount of bitcoin on purchasing a new smartphone if they felt the amount of bitcoin they were intending to spend would be worth 10% more in a months time\n\n**Yes** and Joe ought to be reluctant. But this isn't deflation and this won't go on forever. Eventually (probably within 3 years), there will be a settling and the crypto-markets will have begun to settle and you'll see deflation.\n\n> there must be a price at which he views the deal he is getting on the phone to outweigh the benefit of waiting?\n\nPrecisely.\n\nThe following explanation has been commented already but I want to give you my take:\n\n\n**However**, look at it this way, even with this type of growth, eventually the smartphone becomes cheap enough to buy. Let's assume Joe has exactly enough bitcoin for his smartphone, but doesn't want to spend it because in a month his net worth increases by 10%. This means if he waits 4 years his smartphone he wanted (assuming the latest model is the same price as the latest model he was interested in 4 years ago) which would have cost him 100% of his BTC would now cost him 1% of his BTC. Eventually your need or desire for the smartphone outweighs your greed for increasing your net worth. And when it's only 1% of your net worth, then it's easier to justify, especially when that 10% from all your holdings NOW would afford you 10 of those phones!\n\nThis scenario is unrealistic though, we might see some of this during the discovery phase, but there are a lot of us who have needs and desires that are great enough that we'll be spending our BTC long before that.\n\n**Further** you are making that decision already. I know it's hard to conceptualize and see, but realize that YOU personally are in this EXACT situation today. Any purchase you make, you *could've* diverted those funds to buying crypto to realize those gains Joe is realizing. The fact of the matter is, you need things, so you make the active choice to spedn rather than hodl. You may justify or excuse yourself in saying \"it's fiat though\", but it's not, it's ALL net worth. This is a critical failure a lot of people have in the crypto-verse, especially Bitcoin. They have this psychological barrier that forbids them to spend Bitcoin under the hodl mantra, but it's not true. If you have a purchase to make this instance, if you fuel your auto with 15 euro worth of petrol, regardless of whether you spent euro or bitcoin you spent 15 euro equivalency for it (ignoring transaction fees etc). Your net value is no different between making the purchase with euro and making it with BTC. It's counter-intuitive, but it is true. I'll argue this indefinitely so feel free to engage me, I might make a post about it and I'll go more in depth there.\n\n\n> So this balancing of predicted future value of the coin between people would allow the market to find that tipping point.\n\nNo, it won't happen like this. When the price evens out Bitcoin will normalize, and deflate. It will always tend to be more valuable over another printed currency. Any printed currency is going to inflate and bitcoin will deflate so everyone not a fool will know that the speculation on the price of bitcoin going down with respect to a printable fiat is a losers game. They'll discover this quickly so the market of predicted future value cannot work like you're suggesting. I say \"printable\" because countries will begin producing their own state-sponsored cryptos, and these will often be deflationary in nature too. It'll be interesting to see what happens with this because states like control, and if they control it, they can add to the block height and \"print\" a crypto too and I think most people will see through that and it'll still be a \"printed\" currency, just without the cost of actual printers.\n\n\n___\nAfter all that, here are some takeaways.\n\n(1) Bitcoin will be deflationary and that's a good thing, but that's not where the growth is coming from right now.\n\n(2) Whether it's speculative growth or deflationary growth, there will always be a price at which you're willing to part with one good for another, so the market will naturally figure this out.\n\n(3) Bitcoin as a mainstream currency isn't actually all that viable yet in the day to day, but absolutely with scaling solutions it will be so you can look forward to that, and a steady increase in value until we've figured out how Bitcoin is going to be used in the long run and which sister currencies come alongside it, which currencies grab which markets, etc.", 6], ["2017-11-21 06:32:46", "Yesterday I went out to a restaurant.

Real humans like using computers though, and so will buy one *now* rather than waiting a year to buy one that's better.\n\nBut that's just looking at the buyer. lets look at a computer seller: they have lots of computers and they don't use any of them. They also expect that computers next year will be better and cheaper, so if they hold on too long their computers will depreciate rapidly.

We've all got it, nobody needs to acquire anymore. An interesting thought experiment at this point is: what would sticker prices be pegged to?

Yes bitcoin is deflationary by construction but it is not designed to increase in value this fast. What we are seeing now is a transient phase.\nThe other point, that having a currency that is deflationary by construction is not going to be a problem because eventually the market will sort things out, it's harder to agree with.\n\nIf you follow the current economic debate, you see that there is a lot of uncertainty about the optimal amount of inflation needed for running an economy in the most efficient way.\nNo one will tell you that it has to be exactly 2% or exactly 9%.\nHowever there is a consensus in mainstream economics that some inflation is needed. Now I am not an economist, and I will not pretend to know more than a college trained economist just because I read some stuff on the internet. So I would not dismiss the fact that most economists argue that deflation is bad and that deflation is present by construction in bitcoin.\n\nWe can see the problem from different points of view. You see it from the consumer's point of view. But what about the entrepreneur's point of view? \nImagine that you need a loan to start a business. If you don't want to go bankrupt you need to earn enough to repay the loan. This is hard to do even with positive inflation. Under deflation it will be harder: why would I take a risk by lending my money, if it increases in value just by holding it? This means that interest rates will be higher.\nHigher interest rates mean that businesses that could be profitable with some inflation become unprofitable under deflation.\nPeople will argue that this is not a problem, because good investment will still be profitable. It is bad investments that will go bust.\nBut is this true? What about business ideas that need time to become profitable? It will be harder for them to take off. What about the not-so-good investments that would still be barely profitable and survive under mild inflation and have to close down under deflation? Where do we draw the line?\n\nFinally, I think the biggest issue is not with deflation per se, but with the fact that it is embedded in the currency in a way that cannot be tampered with. It is predictably, algorithmically taking place, and there is no way to increase or decrease it in special circumstances.\nThere is no monetary policy if the whole economy switches to bitcoin. There is no way to come up with a stimulus plan. No bail out. No \"the FED lowers interest rate\".

Ultimately (setting aside network effects, which I don't think are relevant to this), competition between cryptocurrencies will be on the basis of utility, which is some combination of security / decentralization, and speed / cost of transactions (with the former of primary importance).  This amounts to competition between tech:  how to get the cheapest / fastest transactions without compromising security.  So I think it's all about tech, and to my mind the obvious way forward, with the best tech, is layer 2.  \n\n> Bitcoin is in a vulnerable place.\n\nYou don't explain why you think this - but I disagree strongly.  This has been a truly momentous year, not because of the price, but because bitcoin survived the first major attack from vested interests - and the tech (above) won.

You'd lock up coins to a special address on the legacy/mainchain area, which will magically cause the UTXO to appear in the extension/sidechain area.  Then to transfer back to the legacy/mainchain area you'd spend any of the special addresses (doesn't matter which one as long as the rules are correctly followed) and the UTXO will also be deleted in the extension/sidechain area.  The difference between a softfork-blocksize-increase and a sidechain is that the rules of a sidechain won't be enforced by the mainchain fullnodes (meaning sidechains are inherently of inferior security) while a softfork-blocksize-increase's extension block's rules *will* be enforced by mainchain fullnodes.\n\ngmaxwell /u/nullc: \"So I think by a really strong definition of creating a blockchain which violates the rules mandated by prior versions we have never had a hardfork.\" https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=702755.msg8116032#msg8116032\n\nSo yes, we've never had a hardfork (for a sufficiently strong definition of hardfork), and I don't think we can ever have a hardfork.  The fact that Bitcoin fullnodes are relatively widespread and still in-use by many individuals actually holding coins with fullnodes of their own means that hardforks are not going to work IMO, not even if a large part of Core agrees to a hardfork.\n\nMy understanding (maybe /u/andytoshi can confirm) one possible path for MimbleWimble would be as a Bitcoin extension block.  This has the major advantage that data in the MimbleWimble extension block can be very aggressively pruned, leaving only the UTXO set and the R set (I think, I don't really understand the math that well, but every movement from legacy to MimbleWimble extension requires this R number so that it can be verified).  Initial block download would only require downloading of legacy blocks, but not require downloading of MimbleWimble extension blocks, only the UTXO set and R set, which will reduce the barrier-to-entry of new fullnodes.\n\n>Is there any way that average users like us get to talk with core devs ?

I agree that it does not make any changes that would make formerly invalid transactions valid.\n\nStill, for the sake of an argument, let's concede that it is not a hard-fork under the narrowest of definitions of a hard-fork.\n\nWhat we need to understand is why we are talking about hard forks in the first place. This whole differentiation between hard-fork and soft-forks exists in the first place because of a misconception that hard-forks are somehow more dangerous than soft-forks (the term hard-fork does not even exists outside Bitcoin, as far as I am aware). There is no evidence to suggest that hard-forks are dangerous. \n\nWhat does a hard-fork do?\n\n1. **A hard-fork would make old nodes incompatible with the Bitcoin network.** - That has been done once before with nodes before 0.2.10 being made incompatible with zero problems. \n\n2. **A hard-fork could split the chain.** - That has happened before and was resolved without major problems. BIP 50.\n\n3. **A hard-fork can create two alterante coin** - Has happened with BTC/BCH and BTC/BCG before. No major disruptions, again. There are a few more pointless forks coming up in the next new months.\n\nNone of these scenarios are new. It's not like a hard-fork is an alien from outer-space that we know nothing about. All the possible outcomes of a hard-fork (clean fork; chain-split that is resolved with one chain being abandoned; and creation of an alternate coin)  are known and have been seen on the Bitcoin network itself before without causing the network to fail or even causing any significant disruptions. We are all replying to a thread that suggested that hard-forks are impossible because they have not been done before. They are not impossible. Bitcoin has had hard-forks before. Or, even if you use a very narrow definition, the longest BTC chain has not been hard-forked but all situations that may arise after a hard-fork have been tested on it. There is no reason to consider it impossible or difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, not even considering the possibility of hard-forks is what led to the situation of the BTC/BCH split and the cancelled S2X fork. \n\nI do agree that the event of SegWit coins being stolen are very unlikely. However, SegWit via a soft-fork does leave open an attack vector that would not have existed in SegWit via hard-fork. My contention is that keeping support for old nodes through soft-forks make the network less secure and more vulnerable to attacks. Do you disagree with that?\n\nConsider a hypothetical situation in the future where a government wants to move coins from a SegWit address and compels miners to do that through legal notices. And it would be easier to do that with SegWit addresses as it uses the anyone-can-spend hack to make it work as a soft-fork. Consider the possibility that the wallet belongs to something like WikiLeaks. Most people might not even object to such government-backed stealing. A hard-fork would simply eliminate that possibility. ", 1], ["2017-12-02 05:24:47", "> I would argue that from a protocol standpoint, there has never been a hard fork for an \"upgrade\"...

An \"upgrade\" to the client protocol? That made previous versions incompatible with the network?\n\nIf we simply define a soft-fork as fork that is backwards compatible and a hard-fork as a fork that requires all users to upgrade their software, making previous versions incompatible, then Bitcoin has had hard-forks.\n\nIf we define a hard-fork as an unresolved chain split, then Bitcoin has had a hard-fork as mentioned in BIP 50 (even though it was temporary and was resolved fairly quickly).\n\nAlso, even without considering the above two situations, the Bitcoin blockchain has certainly been hard-forked into the BCH and BCG chains recently.

In a decentralized network hardforks are impossible without launching a new altcoin.

You can't choose to not make your transactions on the other chain. If there is no replay-protection, then your transactions will go through on both.

With that said, I'll try to offer the most objective account that I can.\n\nBitcoin is a pretty great technology, but one of the biggest challenges at the moment is how to scale it.  The core team has done an excellent job at improving efficiency so far, and last I checked, the network can process about 4 transactions per second.  For a decentralized system, that's a pretty fantastic achievement.  The question in, how do we improve on that?\n\nCurrently, throughput is constrained by the fact that transactions cost a certain amount of data to be recorded, and current consensus rules limit the size of a block to 1MB.\n\nAround 2 years ago, there began a big increase of debate and discussion on whether or not it would be prudent to increase the blocksize limit to something higher than 1MB.  At first glance, this seems like a logical step to take.  This would allow more throughput, letting more people use the ecosystem.\n\nBut it doesn't come without costs.  Larger blocks place greater demands on the system.  Firstly, it will make running a node more expensive by increasing the grow if the UTXO set, requiring more processing power to validate blocks, and probably most importantly: will increase bandwidth cost.  Also, larger blocks take longer to propagate throughout the network, which will encourage more miner centralization.\n\nProponents of big blocks who do not ignore these costs simply consider it a worthy trade-off for scaling.  Many others, like myself, do not considering this a worthy trade-off, especially when there are other scaling avenues available to us.\n\nWhich brings us to segwit.  Segwit's main benefit is a fix to the transactions malleability problem.  This opens up doors for some fantastic 2nd layer scaling solutions.  Segwit also provides a modest blocksize increase, provides incentives for reducing the UTXO set, and solves the quadratic hashing problem, which decreases a serious issue with block validation times in an increasing network size.  Furthermore, it can provide these benefits via a soft fork, which comes with significantly lower risks to the network than a hard fork.\n\nEven if I am trying to be charitable to those that disagree with me, I cannot think of a single technical criticism of segwit that makes any sense.  You might ask why it is so hated, but I'll get to that later on.\n\nNow, let's get back to the blocksize increase, and BU.  The blocksize increase issues that I described above apply to any blocksize increase, even a single jump.  I think that an increase to 2mb would be a poor decision, but I don't think it would be a disaster.  BU, I am confident, would be disastrous.\n\nBitcoin Unlimited promotes a system which they call \"emergent consensus\" which, in a nutshell, means that miners have the freedom to gradually increase blocksize over time.  The idea is that miners would need to agree on a reasonable blocksize, because it is in their interest to have a healthy and functioning network.  It does not, however, solve the tragedy of the commons problem in that it is in every single miner's interest to mine the largest block possible at a given time to scoop up as many fees as possible, which will almost certainly result in an ever-increasing blocksize.  One could imagine a scenario where miners all cooperate and collude to agree on a smaller blocksize, but this basically requires putting the network into the hands of a mining cartel.\n\nNow, those are the problems with BU, and that's assuming that it even works correctly.  If you take a look at the development process of BU, you'll find a lot of major red flags.  Every few weeks, a bug gets exploited by some adversary which causes a huge number of BU nodes to crash.  The BU team has shown to be indignant and rude to those reporting bugs to them on several occasions, and there are serious concerns regarding their code review process, or lack thereof.  Add to this the fact that developers actually write in insults to their political opponents in their source code.\n\nAt this point, I *think* I've done a good job at answering your first question, but that leaves us with:\n\n> why is this very controversial stuff?\n\nThere are a few factors here, but the first one I'll point out is money.  This is a project with near 30 billion dollars at stake.  People are going to have opinions, and with a system lacking leadership, it would be nothing short of miraculous if we didn't end up with controversies like this.\n\nBitcoin is fucking complicated.  And when you have a system that many are using, but few understand, it becomes incredibly easy to spread disinformation.\n\nI advise anyone to be really skeptical of arguments that rely on rhetoric, instead of technical substance.  One of the anti-core favorites is along the lines of \"the developers have technical understanding, but no economic understanding\".  This might sounds reasonable on its face, but has zero substance to it.  There's a reason no one uses this argument in other fields.  If a city wants to build a bridge, and engineers design one and tell them they can safely build one that handles six lanes of traffic, you don't see businesses banding together, demanding it to be widened it to 20 lanes under the claim that the engineers don't understand the economic situation.\n\nNotice how it takes 2 seconds to make a faulty claim like that, but it takes a lot longer to respond to it.\n\nYou'll notice that arguments against segwit in particular are composed either entirely of rhetoric, or if they are technical, can be extremely quickly refuted.\n\nThere is also a problem that the bitcoin scene has largely been divided into two tribes, which compounds the problem.  Many believe there has been a misuse of moderation power at bitcointalk.org and r/bitcoin, particularly surrounding the blocksize issue.  Since the moderators there are supportive of the core team, this has resulted in resentment toward the core developers as a group.  Since segwit came from core, this became something that \"the enemy\" wants, so is hated that way.  Others see segwit as a bargaining chip, in that they will refuse to support segwit unless they get their preferred blocksize increase in exchange.\n\nLastly, recent revelations regarding asicboost have shown that a pretty serious bug has caused a misalignment of incentives.  Currently, it is very likely the asic manufacturer and mining pool bitmain/antpool are enjoying a huge boost in efficiency over other miners.  This boost would be negated if segwit rolls out.  Considering the disproportionate resources controlled by bitmain, this does a great deal to explain why, despite having a technical understanding, certain parties still oppose segwit.\n\nThere's probably more I could say on this, but I think this comment is long enough.

You are assuming that fastest internet available, assuming that it will take up 100% of your bandwidth (pretty sure no one wants that), and lastly, you don't need to have a connection speed equal to the amount of bandwidth produced by the average block.

I agree that inflation is nonstarter. There will be a fee market, just not an artificially induced one with a limited block size. Miners want to make profit. There is a certain cost to processing transactions (electricity, hardware, maintenance, etc.) and so they can't charge less than the costs to run it. If users want their transaction to be included in a block, they will have to pay what miner effectively \"charge\". Miners will be prevented from overcharging because other miners will undercut them.\n\nIf fees are kept high, there will be other cryptos that do not have block size limits (resulting in lower fees) that will gain usage.

I'm saying a billion users who pay $1 in fees is better for bitcoin than 10 million users paying $100 in fees. If it somehow becomes unprofitable to mine ( I don't see how ), users who need to have their transactions processed will mine. As long as there is a need to send bitcoin, mining will be profitable.

Even with all of the layer 2, 1MB is simply not enough, a HF will have to happen. Why not do a SWHF alleviate pressure and buy more time? It's also practice for HF while bitcoin is relatively small and to prove HF can be done. 2MB is perfectly safe in terms of decentralization.\n\n> No other network has even close to the throughput that bitcoin has.

This reduces fees paid to miners and diminishes bitcoin security, it's not the original design intent and ends in centralized control and depressurization of layer 1 as the mining subsidy is exhausted. \n\nThe other side wants miners to compete in a market for fees based on a marginal profit on the cost of production where economies of scale drive users to transact encouraging adoption and growing the network. Users benefit from low friction to transact adding value to the network, and miners constantly competing for market share increases bitcoin security. \n\n>You think that even if a node had to process 72GB of blocks every day, there would be no impact on centralization?\n\nI think the system would remain in a successful state where there is no single point of failure or control if there was such demand or capacity for bitcoin transactions. \n\nThe transaction limit is determined by the capacity of the network. Market forces would curb transaction capacity before blocks got near the limit. We will never see blocks larger than the network limit.

Even if you don't agree with them, there exist a variety of valid arguments again increasing the blocksize.  Many people like myself, who have no connection to any nefarious parties (I'm an English teacher, if you want to know my identity, I'd be happy to share this with you by pm, but you'll find it quite boring), are against a blocksize increase.

They're at a much greater level of scale than I thought.\n\nI don't feel too worried, though, because of my other concerns.  They rely on some shaky techniques to achieve this, like sharding, which means fewer people actually keep track of the full network (thus, more centralized).  They rely on their uncle system to help with their fast block times, of which the economic implications are not yet well understood.  On top of that, their blockchain already surpassed bitcoin in size.

When that happens, we'd see people will to pay even greater fees, since their base layer transactions would have such a higher degree of functionality.\n\n> I think the system would remain in a successful state where there is no single point of failure or control if there was such demand or capacity for bitcoin transactions.\n\nOk, so you don't actually believe, as you said above. that there would be no impact on centralization?

Not that it was bad, persay, it just doesn't address my concerns. Also, I don't think that bitcoin has 10 usecases, I think it has waayyyyy more. I think that without full blocks, we'll see basically unconstrained demand - if fees are really cheap, then people can just use the blockchain as free storage space. This is, of course, an extreme example, but I'm using it to demonstrate my point: when blocks aren't full, it seems extremely that there will always be constantly upward pressure on the size, leading to blocks large enough to case serious problems with the network.\n\nWhat's unconvincing? I agree that bitcoin has more than 10 use cases, it was just an example but wouldn't you agree that it has lost use cases to alt coins?. Yes, there is unconstrained demand and what constrains it is the fees which miners charge. The upward pressure means there is growth. We know blocks do not have to be full because bitcoin worked just fine for 7 years before it hit the 1MB limit. Technology gets better to support bigger blocks so I don't see why we need to restrict usage and growth when 2MB is safe. I don't see the need to risk bitcoin's lead.\n\n> Another way to word this would be to point out that every single usecase comes at a certain cost to the network. To use the cliche example, I think that ensuring you can buy coffee on-chain comes at too great a cost to the network for us to prioritize. But I'm not saying we have to abandon that usecase entirely - I just want lightning coffee.\n\nThat's true. Just that right now, lightning coffee isn't ready. I guess I feel like we have a Ford model T (bitcoin) and we can release an upgraded model (bitcoin with 2MB) before producing cheap highly efficient electric cars (lightning). I see that sales of the Model T, while still good, is slowing down and I think it's because there are trolleys, buses, planes, segways (all the altcoins) etc being developed. \n\n> Do you think that blocks should never been consistently full? \n\nI would like to let the market decide. So if costs too much for miners to process transactions, they will charge more which will curve demand.\n\n> Worded another way: do you think that every time they become full for a long enough time, there should be a blocksize increase? Otherwise, I don't see how the blocksize wouldn't continuously need to grow.\n\nYes, if there are no other ways to handle transactions. Block size increase would plateau when the user base has plateaued. \n\n> Where I don't agree is on the effectiveness of competing tech. My understanding is that xthin has been very poorly reviewed, is what has been causing the recent BU crashes. Also, flexible transactions has some outstanding issues that I haven't seen addressed. Admittedly, I don't know anything about compact blocks, so I'll go and look that up.\n\nYeah, but my point is that there are layer 1 improvements that can help immediately (that does not rely on user opt in - segwit). Compact blocks are core's response to flextrans. From what I understand it's bitcoin efficiency improvements but the technical details are over my head.\n\n> I'm curious, what is your opinion on segwit? I don't think you've actually said. It seems like the best possible advancement in bridge-building techniques available at the moment.\n\nI'm not against segwit but the way it was released and done from a public and human relations standpoint was terrible. I essentially saw it as \"this is segwit as a soft fork, take it or leave it\" which Greg has effectively said. As for the tech, I think its benefits should have been coded as a hard fork along with 2MB so that there less unknowns like the effects of block weight. \n\n> I don't feel too worried, though, because of my other concerns. They rely on some shaky techniques to achieve this, like sharding, which means fewer people actually keep track of the full network (thus, more centralized). They rely on their uncle system to help with their fast block times, of which the economic implications are not yet well understood. On top of that, their blockchain already surpassed bitcoin in size. I have also heard rumblings of ethereum's fees getting pretty high, but I'll have to look that up.\n\nThe economic implications of bitcoin and block size aren't fully understood either (which is why we get so many economic 'experts' thinking bitcoin will fail - we know better heheh). Looking at the TXs at https://etherscan.io/txs they seem to average $0.07 to $0.10 USD. I couldn't find a fee history though. It might be why they are moving to PoS.\n\n> I actually would feel kind of the same about moving to 300kb as I would about moving to 2mb. Not supportive, persay, but I wouldn't freak out.\n\nDang really? I would need a very good reason to reduce the block size and I would be freaking out if the next version of Bitcoin Core had that haha.\n\n> It just seems like such a minor change when I consider what transaction malleability and 2nd layers could do.\n\nI think it's a major change considering that layer 2 isn't ready. I would not be asking for a block increase if lightning was rolling out right now where I can download and use it but it's not. It might seem minor but there would be a never ending backlog of transactions (which I think will force users to other chains).\n\n> Right now, I'm basically rooting for UASF. In the meantime, if this segwit + 2mb compromise rolls out, though, I'd be stoked about that as well.\n\nI don't think UASF has enough support which can't even be accurately measured and easily Sybil attacked. If the total node count increases rather than same node count but more UASF signalling I would think it's a sybil. A little rant/frustration: I think it's hypocritical for r\\bitcoin to allow discussion of UASF when discussion for XT and Classic were banned in the past. Theymos' actions made me furious. I largely blame him for the current 'civil war'. \n\n> I'm not sure about this. I just started running my own node about 2 months ago, and it's basically on the edge of what I'd bother keeping up and running. 300kb would be a lot less strain on my machine, and I'd be able to run it in the background without seeing such a dramatic hit to performance.\n> If we go to 2mb, I'm not sure if I'd continuing running it. But that's all anecdotal, I don't claim to be representative of anyone other than me.\n\nYes more research needs to be done. How many nodes is enough decentralization to you? I would rather have a billion users with 100,000 nodes (ratio of  10000:1) rather than 10 million users and 10,000 nodes (ratio of 1000:1). I don't know where you're located but the internet service isn't completely decentralized to the user level but it works (granted in the USA it could be much better if there wasn't a damn oligopoly).\n\nThanks for your time.

When BTC ownership is centralized it becomes worthless, so creating an economic model that consolidates bitcoin ownership would then be a centralizing force - such forces create wealth inequality and bitcoin being voluntary can not attract users it it subjects them to wealth inequality.   \n\nThis centralization is the most dangerous form of centralization it caused the collapses of the British Empire and now the collapse of Western civilizations. Developers dont focus on this because they don't understand the quantity of money theory. limiting transaction quantity centralize bitcoin ownership and does nothing for decentralizing decision making and control.

I'm not saying this is you necessarily, but it blows my mind to see some big blockers claim that lightning doesn't count because it's not ready, while at the same time fighting against the very thing that will enable lightning to happen sooner.\n\nYes, I'm okay with what segwit does.

The action of core devs irrationally against a HF when people were warning about the block size and their view of blocks needing to be full is what I'm against. They are acting like central planners by saying bitcoin needs to be a certain way.\n\nSo lightning is out and it's in full use with 1MB blocks. No study has been done how much onchain fees will be. If everyone is on layer 2 and 90% can't afford on chain fees, is it still decentralized? The fact that you have lock up a much larger amount than you are going to use doesn't make practical sense to me.\n\n> I don't have an exact number, but for me, long-term scaling with minimal centralization costs (basically, the core road map) seems like a far better option than a single bump that comes with added network stress.\n\nBut there will always be a trade off.

I'd love to :)\n\nPrevious Peer to Peer currencies failed because the only way to prevent double spending was to have a central point of control. This meant that there was a single point of failure, thus, eventually all these projects eventually failed for one reason or another.   \n \nBitcoin is different. Bitcoin avoids central control by distributing control among the users. This issue is, how do you distribute control in a way that is not easy to game. That is, how do you stop one user from appearing as 1000 users. Ideally each user would have one vote to rule changes, but this is not possible, as there is not yet a way to ensure that each person only votes once whilst remaining (pseudo)anonymity.   \n\n   \nTo solve this problem bitcoin respects the 'democratic' will of the network's hashpower. Hashpower cannot be faked. If you appear to have X amount of hashpower you have X amount of hashpower. Bitcoin is designed such that the majority hashpower dictates the network rules, which eliminates the single point of failure of a central planning group / individual. Now yes, mining has become centralised to some extent, and this is an issue that needs to be addressed - I agree. However thinking that using a metric other than hashpower to reach consensus (such as signalling nodes in a UASF) is, in my opinion, misguided.  \n  \nSee the Bitcoin Whitepaper:\n> The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. \n  \nThe Bitcoin network is a one-CPU-one-Vote system.

In one, I agree with you: hashpower being the single deciding factor in determining legitimate PoW chain, that is, the state of the ledger (to make sure now double-spend, not cheating, etc).\n\nOn the other hand, consensus regarding protocol upgrades occupy a different space (in my mind, anyway).  Ideally, miners will represent the will of the users, which leads to relatively smooth updates, as they have in the past.

If someone starts a venture, they issue their own token that can be redeemed for their unique service. It's not really debt and it's not really stock, it's something completely new. I can't say whether ICOs will be the final way that people raise capital for businesses. But, let's do a thought experiment.\n\nSay you want to open a bakery in the brave new cypherpunk future. But, you need to be able to pay for a lease on a building, you need ovens, supplies and money for salaries. You need a more widely accepted currency. Something like bitcoin. So, what you do is you go onto a website that lets anyone create their own cryptocurrency. You call it \"Latocoin\". You go to a lender and say, hey I'm opening a bakery and I need 1 bitcoin to get started. I will give you 50% of the maximum possible Latocoins, which will be the primary currency of my business. I will require people to transact in it to buy my products.\n\nWhy would he take that loan? Well if the lender believes you have the right stuff to make your bakery succeed he knows that your coin will be valuable because people will need it to buy your product. If he holds it and slowly sells it off as your business ramps up he can generate an income off Latocoin holdings thanks to people buying your bread.\n\nBut wait, why would people buy Latocoins? Wouldn't they prefer to use their bitcoins to buy your bread? Well this is a brave new crypto future remember? In this future atomic swaps are handled transparently and instantly. People don't really notice or care that their wallet is exchanging bitcoins for Latocoins and making the purchase.\n\nWait! Where are the Latocoins coming from? Well when the doors of the business first open you, your lender and maybe some other investors hold Latocoins. So your customers are buying Latocoins from you or your investors (transferring bitcoins). They then immediately give the Latocoins back to you in exchange for the bread. Again, the wallet just handles all of this transparently. The result is the value of Latocoins will tend to float relative to the more dominant currency being used by the customer.\n\nIf the bakery is successful then the Latocoins would transfer from the investors/lenders back to you slowly over time as they sell them off to your customers.\n\nIf it is a failure then you'll be forced to liquidate your assets and buy back all the Latocoins from your investors with whatever bitcoins you can get. But, there's nothing forcing this unless there is a real world contract that gives the lender the right to request liquidation.\n\nThere are probably many other schemes that could be devised to solve the lending problem.

I am going to buy my house on a 30 year fixed mortgage. \n\nAt time 0, a bitcoin buys $500,000 worth of goods in 2017 dollars. The bank has deciphered that bitcoin appreciates at a rate of approx 4% a year on average. That means that you expect a bitcoin to be worth $1,621,000 in 30 years (denominated in 2017 dollars). For it to make sense for you to lend me this coin, you need to make more than 4% a year on your loan (or for me to pay you back a value of over $1,621,000 in 2017 dollars).\n\nBecause you must make at least that much money back, the standard for lending would be very high. As I am going to spend this bitcoin immediately to buy a house, I will not be able to gain that 4% compounding value per year. So, either I need to be pretty sure the house will be worth more than $1.6 million in 30 years (not impossible), or I just need to make a lot of money in order to justify making those monthly payments back to the bank. \n\nIts a similar story for business loans. As I will be spending the bitcoin immediately to buy capital goods, I again will not be able to gain that 4% annually that I would had I held the coin I borrowed. You, as the bank, and I would both need to be reasonably convinced that my business plan was sure-fire enough to justify spending that coin today and foregoing the likelihood of a 4% return per year (this is also not impossible). \n\nI think in the short term, we would see interest rates go VERY high and the bar for lending would thus also be quite high (since the higher your interest rates are, the more likely you will put someone in a place where they have to default). The margin for error on a loan with a 15% interest rate is very slim. \n\nOver time, I think the deflationary nature of bitcoin would settle down quite a lot, and perhaps level off for the most part. I could be wrong. In the meantime, I don't think banks will find it impossible to find people worth loaning to at those crazy rates. If a business is good enough, it would easily return more than 4% a year or more. AS for homes, that's harder to make those kinds of returns, in which case, the loan won't happen, and we really wouldn't want it to. Home prices with then fall because the home must be sold.

Extreme things happen, who can predict how extreme they'll be in 30 years, don't borrow assets that are increasing in value...\n\nNow the other side of this coin is we could always have another great depression.

User interest of 30k TXN per hour (30k users)\n4. The 'dice' wallet assigns fees using RNG between 0-200 sat/B (crazy I know).\n5.

Problem is, that most of the low fee band TXNs age out of the mempool and never get processed (hence no fee paid).  This is what (in theory) the (fictitious) spammer is banking on.  It wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that modern wallets will calculate fees based on mempool population.  So the spam TXNs being part of that population causes (forces) wallets to up the fees.  It is very clever and very profitable.  The end result is that TXNs will always be priced at the highest level people will accept.  This is exactly why the price of TXNs are trending towards the pricing in remittance markets.

Age out TXN very rapidly and encourage wallets to roll back TXNs rapidly under the assurance that the aggressive age-out protocols were in place.

If blockstream becomes an issue in the future, we simply thank them for their effort, take all their work and pivot away from them.

Dave gets a transaction that so he can do the same. If Dave then makes a transfer of 2 Bitcoins to you, you get a new transaction that you can sign and commit at any time which will give you 7 Bitcoins and Dave will get 3 Bitcoins. In order to make sure that Dave doesn't submit the first transaction state when it was 5 Bitcoins each, Dave will give you a revocation transaction that says if Dave signs and commits the first (now invalid) transaction state, you will be able to sign and commit the revocation transaction and take all the coins in the channel. \n\nThe only way for that to work, is if there is a time limit, so you can catch Dave in the act of stealing your coins and can instead send the revocation transaction and get all the coins as a reward for catching Dave.

It is *very*, **very** hard to force a backwards-incompatible change on the network, and therein lies the value of Bitcoin. It's still early days, so you might instinctively want to dismiss the possibility that perpetual-inflation will be seriously lobbied for, but to me that sounds like you haven't really taken a long-term view on the subject or thought things through critically.

Competition is good. Bitcoin will remain Bitcoin, though. And I'm not personally scared of altcoins, because so far, I haven't seen any that actually *fundamentally improve* on the Bitcoin model; right now, Bitcoin is the most efficient and optimized monetary technology that exists. Those who argue otherwise generally lack a *lot* of insight, in my experience.\n\n>If the devs are refusing to address that as a concern\n\nYou mean like **more-than-doubling the blocksize limit a few months ago with a soft fork, massive improvements in the block relay network, signature aggregation and syntax tree improvements, UTXO bloat mitigation, transaction serialization and versioning improvements, SPV and fraud-proof progress (and compaction), sidechains and Drivechains like Mimblewimble and Rootstock, and developing second-layer tech like the Lightning Network**?\n\n>I have no great sympathy for anything else they are doing, because they are unwittingly stalling adoption of Bitcoin.\n\nAdoption is at unprecedentedly high levels...\n\n>They have certainly made it unusable for me.\n\nThey have added features and improved scalability on a number of fronts (some of which I haven't even mentioned here). If you don't consider Bitcoin to be \"usable\" and you don't actually want to take advantage of the value-add that it represents, that is not the fault of the developers who have been integrating countless improvements in the background as you type frivolous reddit comments.\n\nObviously, the majority of Bitcoin users *do* value Bitcoin, and the network is growing more and more by the day. Demand has been skyrocketing. Your own choice not to become a Bitcoin user is yours and yours alone, and it is not up to any one developer to convince you otherwise. All they can do is work on the improvements that they personally prioritize, and you have no right to demand anything else out of them. Remember: these are *volunteers*, and every single one of them has *far* more invested into Bitcoin (in terms of blood, sweat, tears, *and* money) than you do.\n\n>You are free propose and defend solutions that best fit your cause but they are absolutely useless to me and a lot of people unless they address the main concern of transaction fees and times. Maybe you can, but the majority of the world's population cannot do transactions that can cost anywhere between $2 to $20 in fees.\n\nAnd fundamentally, a mass-scale, highly-demanded decentralized blockchain with a capped final token supply *will* necessitate fees on the base layer. That has been the plan since the very beginning. We *are* building second-layer solutions that will amortize these fees over tens, thousands, or even millions of day-to-day transactions (such that you can pay an average of less-than-a-penny per transaction, in the end, if you use the tools available) while preserving the characteristics that distinguish Bitcoin as a valuable network and platform, and these tools are *just now* coming to fruition (Lightning Network wallets are being tested and used right now, and in fact, if you're interested you can go join in and test things out yourself). People smarter than you or I have been working tirelessly to make this technology a reality, and we're finally reaching the point where we can start taking advantage of it, and leveraging it, and achieving Bitcoin's true potential. What's more, fee-rate reductions *aren't even all that networked payment channels give us!* They also allow **instant, trustless transactions** which simply aren't possible, period, on layer-one.\n\nThe future is arriving, and you're complaining about the past.\n\n>Yes. They are like 1.05 MB now? While what you say is true, it makes no practical difference.\n\nThis indicates rather well *how low of a priority* these \"problems\" you are lamenting *actually* are, to the majority of Bitcoin users. Blocks could be well over 2MB in size (and by the way, measuring \"success\" in \"blocksizes\" is backwards; ceteris paribus, we want blocksizes to be *as small as possible* while transaction **throughput** should be *as high as possible*). The fact that they are not, because users aren't in any rush to start using the tools that give them major fee discounts and capacity increases, demonstrates beyond any doubt how big of a deal we (in aggregate) consider that to be. That is to say, not a big deal at all.\n\n>Does the Bitcoin Core team have a designer in the team?\n\nYes, plenty. It's not really a team with \"fixed boundaries\", though, like you seem to be assuming.

If they have a useful idea, they will succeeded. If they don\u2019t, they will fail. Let the users decide what they want.

So, yes, they have entirely failed to address that concern. They may not care about it, and they may find other things more interesting than solving high fees, but that\u2019s a different matter.

In fact, when the NYA agreement (which you are presumably referring to) was signed behind closed doors, an incredibly voluminous uproar manifested among these other stakeholders. An entire \"NO2X\" movement was born in response to the attempted takeover and rule-foisting.\n\nFar more companies opposed the NYA hard fork than supported it (orders of magnitudes more, in fact).

Plus, the [paper](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/CKWN-CCS16.pdf) on fee-sniping in the **absence** of inflation, which you seem to be referring to, does not even consider putting a block size limit as an option for Bitcoin mining to remain stable.

I agree that both the 21 million coin limit and the 1 MB block-size limit are arbitrary.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference though. The 21 million cap was always meant to be a permanent hard cap. The purpose of introducing the 1 MB block-size limit was, however, for it to only act as a **temporary** measure to prevent denial-of-service attack. That is a very well-documented fact. It was meant to be removed when that need expired. Like it has now. Unlike the 21 million coin cap, it was not put in place to act as a way of enforcing a certain type of economic pressure to move Bitcoin towards a certain direction. It was never meant to be permanent.\n\nThe idea of not increasing block-size limits in order to create an artificial fee-auction market counts as a policy intervention as much as removing the 21 million hard cap would be a policy intervention.\n\n> Large enough to incentivize enough hashrate to make Bitcoin unamenable to deliberate chain reorganizations (double-spends) in the absence of significant inflation.\n\nThat can range from anywhere between 1 sat to 100,000 BTC or even more.

Right?\n\n> Bitcoin demonstrated exactly how decentralized and powerful it is with the rejection of the NYA fork.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nIf, for example, the Chinese government issued a legal order to all Chinese miners to reverse or prevent a certain transaction, wouldn't they most likely end up being successful as majority of hashpower lies in China? The most you can do is fork off to another chain with minority hash power that may not even end up surviving.

If I were to dictate to the developers what they should do I would ask first that they not violate the security of Bitcoin. An important component of Bitcoin is trustlessness, without it, we might as well drop the blockchain and pick up a more efficient system. There are other goals one might have like \"does this keep Bitcoin cheap\" or \"is this what Satoshi said he wanted\", however I don't see the point of achieving these goals if loss of trustlessness is the cost.\n\nGeneral mining situation:\n\n* So does increasing the blocksize put trustlessness in jeopardy? Like most things in security it isn't black and white. The mining ecosystem becomes less secure and more centralized when there is a larger network load. It is a reaction that is caused by the cost of supporting the networks security becoming greater than its benefits. For example, every mining pool member could effectively take the control back from the pool and generate their own blocks, causing a huge decrease in the trust we are required to put in these pools. There is, however, a cost to these individual miners running a full node including additional latency for the pool users, additional resources for the pool if they are using the relay network, and many many other factors that increase as the block size increases.\n\nBenefits to big miners:\n\n* This isn't limited to individual miners in pools either, a certain Chinese mining pool was not validating blocks due to the stales that would be caused, though this can be improved partially with IBLT. The cause of the pool not validating was that their geographic separation from other mining pools made it more expensive to mine fully validating. It actually is very efficient to have all your miners in a geographically centralized area, like a single warehouse, and it becomes even more efficient as the network load increases. In general, as blocks become bigger there is a centralizing effect to the mining ecosystem and that causes the requirement of trust, the antithesis of Bitcoin.\n\nGetting small miners to run full nodes:\n\n* I usually get responses like \"These miners can afford to run full nodes\", but the question isn't whether they can run full nodes, it is whether they will! At what point does a miner benefit from a full node? A 0.1% miner may realize that the expenses of running a full node cut into their profits by 5%, and then through a rough estimate realize that their 0.1% of hash power belonging to a large mining pool doesn't harm the network, and by extension them that much. This leads to them not running a full node. The minimal hash power required for \"profitable\" validation varies based on factors including the loss of profit through latency caused by geographic placement, the gain in personal \"profit\" through the enjoyment that comes from running a full node as a hobby. However, as a general trend, the minimal hash power someone will run a full node at decreases and the cost of a full node increases.\n\nDecreasing attack cost with higher network load: \n\n* At this point, this economy of scale induced effect has led to miners being massive, the largest two miners individually can both reverse a confirmation with 40% probability of success. Combined, they can reverse 6 confirmations with 75% success. This is quite dangerous considering that a single government may attack Bitcoin relatively cheaply, or a profit-seeking miner may decide to attack as we have seen before with the 3000BTC GHash.io theft.\n\nIncreasing attack benefit with higher network load:\n\n* One of the main differences between a miner attacking an SPV-using merchant and a full-node-using merchant is the ability to forge money out of thin air that can't be spent in a reorg. If you, an economical and malicious miner, want to rip off a merchant running a full node, you need to send them YOUR (or your partners) money and **then** spend your hashing power (money) attempting to steal their money. When you rip off a merchant running an SPV node, you can create money out of thin air, create invalid blocks, then be guaranteed that your payment will be reversed. There is no up front cost other than the electricity of your mine and you can block withhold to make your attack much more likely to succeed than the reorg attack mentioned in the full node example. In short, many SPV nodes make miner attacks much more profitable and likely to succeed. But it's not like full nodes don't have to be worried, they too can be caught up in the attack because including a full node target in the attack doesn't cost additional mining resources. The number of full nodes online doesn't matter nearly as much as the number and fraction of merchants validating payments with full nodes.\n\nConclusion:\n\n* We must consider this centralizing effect caused by large blocks and work towards making mining decentralized and the ecosystem safer by reducing the system load. This can be accomplished by having the blocksize increase at a rate lower than the rate at which hardware and software changes decrease the expenses caused by block size.", 3], ["2017-12-10 18:27:30", "> Could you please explain what centralization occurs due to bigger blocks\n\nSure. With large enough blocks only datacenters would be able to process and validate the transactions (datacaps, bandwidth, CPU, RAM and disk space are limiting factors). Then you would have to trust that they don't cheat. And there is no going back from centralization.  \n\nCentralization is a continuum. We could probably increase blocksize 2 times with little harm, go 4-8 times and there will be no immediate danger but the network will become more vulnerable. If almost everybody uses only light clients, they can be sybilized and new vectors of attacks become possible. \n\n> most txs occur in privately run lightning hubs\n\nIt's not a problem at all. First of all, LN is optional. Secondly, there will be many competing hubs and no hub can influence the network.  Lastly, anybody with two channels can create a mini-hub so there will be thousands of possible paths to the destination. It's going to be like the Internet. Sure, it is not completely decentralized, my message goes through some hubs to you but the hubs can go and the connection finds other routes.  ", 2], ["2017-12-13 00:29:53", ">The situation you are talking about is so far way in the future that there is no chance of accurately predicting what may happen.\n\nFirst, I have made *many* predictions multiple years in advance that have turned out to be true (and many of them have had to do with Bitcoin). If you're going to dismiss long-term predictions out of principle, then you're never going to understand the arguments from those of us who take long-term outlooks.\n\nSecond, even the patron saint of big blockers, Mike Hearn, admitted that this was an issue that we needed to consider when discussing the prospect of increasing block-sizes to minimize transaction fees. After all, it is *undeniably* a deviation from Satoshi's original plan for Bitcoin's long-term trajectory. Hearn's argument was that [big businesses could subsidize Bitcoin mining through \"assurance contracts\"](https://medium.com/@octskyward/on-block-sizes-e047bc9f830) and that if they failed to do so adequately, they'd be regularly defrauded through double-spending (which ostensibly would provide them with the necessary incentives to pony up the money into these contracts).\n\nThis is not a joke, this is not a misrepresentation, and this is not a strawman. This is **actually** Mike Hearn's **serious** proposal for how Bitcoin could survive in the years to come, if we committed to raising the blocksize limits as our scaling approach. *This* was Mike Hearn's vision for how Bitcoin could scale. He essentially said: \"Satoshi was wrong, and in the long-term his ideas would fail. Let's rely on assurance contracts instead.\"\n\nUnderneath it all, that's the long-term \"big blocker vision\"; I wouldn't be surprised if you were completely unaware that this was the plan. Many of those who weren't paying close attention (or simply didn't have a significant foundation of knowledge to work from) were (and still are) completely ignorant of these aspects of the \"debate\" that Hearn and Andresen fought so hard to begin.\n\nAnd make no mistake, [Hearn and Andresen *did* start the divide](https://medium.com/@sound8bits/the-origins-of-the-modern-blocksize-debate-2f96c35e7eca). This is all verifiable history.\n\n>I'm sure a more elegant solution can be found before the situation actually comes into play decades later.\n\nTo be completely fair, it was pointed out to me in this thread that **pay forward fees** may actually solve the problems outlined in the paper I referenced. I haven't been able to spot any problems with this logic, so I must admit that a reasonably elegant solution *has* already been proposed (if not yet widely discussed).\n\n>That is a very well-documented fact. It was meant to be removed when that need expired. Like it has now. \n\nWhat gives you the impression that the need has expired? Bitcoin is still vulnerable to DoS attacks (and would be especially so if the blocksize limit were raised past safe thresholds).\n\n>in order to create an artificial fee-auction market \n\nHow is it \"artificial\" in any way? Are you arguing that the fees being paid are *not* actually being paid? I would be interested to hear more about your thoughts on this.\n\n>That can range from anywhere between 1 sat to 100,000 BTC or even more. Surely there are other trade-offs that one has to consider... Like, what effect fees have on demand and merchant adoption? Right?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n>It didn't.\n\nIt did.\n\n>If, for example, the Chinese government issued a legal order to all Chinese miners to reverse or prevent a certain transaction, wouldn't they most likely end up being successful as majority of hashpower lies in China? The most you can do is fork off to another chain with minority hash power that may not even end up surviving. Mining decentralization already seems like a lost battle.\n\nWe could hypothetically *replace the proof-of-work function entirely* if we wanted to. Satoshi himself talked about how this was possible, if the need ever arose.\n\nJust like the blocksize limit could be replaced (and as you say, is not necessarily a \"permanent property of Bitcoin\" like the 21M cap is), so too can the proof-of-work function.\n\nThis possibility serves as a sort of \"nuclear deterrent\", too.\n\n>Would you care to elaborate why?\n\nIn a nutshell: every type of computation (even memory-hard ones) can be specialized or optimized for. It's a question of whether it's economically worthwhile to bother. For truly valuable technologies (like Bitcoin), it's arguably better to let this specialization arms-race play out unimpeded, so that the free market can reach the \"end-game\" as quickly as possible and efficient mining hardware can reach \"consumer availability\" as soon as possible. We're not *quite* there yet (though we may be getting close, as SHA-256d ASICs are now starting to reach industry-standard Moore limits), but some smart people (including Andreas Antonopoulos) have put forth some reasonably compelling arguments that once we *do* get there, mining will \"re-decentralize\" because it's cheaper to focus on manufacturing hardware than to try and focus on manufacturing *and* currency speculation (which is what mining oligarchies like Bitmain are doing now). In other words, let the chip fabs build the ASICs, but then sell them to normal end-users (like you or me) who do the mining.\n\nIt will probably take another few years before we see this phenomenon start to meaningfully play out, and perhaps it's optimistic to hope for it to do *too* much good. But we'll see.\n\n>SegWit has not resulted in a significant increase in block-sizes. \n\nIt's increased the **limit**. The only way that blocksizes themselves will increase is if the excess capacity is *used*, which requires this capacity to be *demanded* by transactors in Bitcoin. By and large, they don't seem to be in a rush to use it.\n\n>And, really, you have not shown any convincing reason why such an increase is not needed at this time.\n\nI have. I've pointed you to metrics that show how low of a priority it seems to be to the average Bitcoin transactor. Bitcoin continues to grow inexorably, too, which helps even more to emphasize how \"not needed\" further size increases are at this juncture.\n\n>Fees are not low.\n\nYes, they are.\n\n>You seem to have completely missed the point about why people want a higher block-size limit\n\nYou seem to have completely missed the point about how *most people don't actually want that at all*, as the data shows.\n\n>high and unreliable fees\n\nWhat does \"high\" mean? What does \"unreliable\" mean? And do either of these definitions stem from a more meaningful source than \"your gut feelings\"?\n\n>Wouldn't you agree that one Bitcoin's most \"important\" and \"valuable\" property is to act as a currency?\n\nBitcoin's most important and valuable property is to be a *decentralized, censorship-resistant, tamper-proof money*. Trying to shoehorn it into legacy terminology like \"currency\" or \"commodity\" only serves to confuse the person doing the shoehorning.\n\n>No, you are unwilling to even consider the fact that high fees are a problem.\n\nI am perfectly willing to consider all available facts. I'm also willing to consider *opinions*, like the one that you're presenting here. Can you honestly say the same?\n\n>You are talking about solving problems that don't even exist yet\n\nYes, and we *should* be talking about problems that don't even exist yet.

Sure, it is not completely decentralized, my message goes through some hubs to you but the hubs can go and the connection finds other routes. \n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong as I am still not fully versed on how lightning works, which is exactly why I look forward to this kind of discussion because it helps me understand, but to use lightning I would have to \"open a channel\".  Opening a channel is done by sending your BTC to a lightning hub which will then maintain your balance for you. Sort of acting as a bank with a checking account. Of course sending btc to the LN hub will create an on chain tx and cost an on chain fee. Then using your btc balance on the LN will cost a lower fee than an on chain tx to the LN hub. If/When you want to withdraw your btc from the LN (your \"change\" if you will) you would then have to once again pay for an on chain tx fee. \n\nAll of this requires the trust in the LN hub. \nWill the LN's ledger be public and censorship resistant like the blockchain? What is the point of running a full node with 1MB blocks if the majority of the txns are done off chain? All of this transaction data is stored somewhere, however it is no longer verified by miners or the block chain. Therefore your transactions are no longer taking place within bitcoin. Are you not essentially just buying LN hub tokens that are only usable on that particular hub with the hope that you can cash them out later hoping that on chain fees are not more than your balance? It feels overly complicated to me all in the name of avoiding a theoretical problem which may never be an issue. Like trying to pay someone in Amazon gift cards as opposed to cash. If you see any glaring flaws in what I have written please point it out. I am by no means an expert but that is how I understand things as they are now.

Full nodes that just sit on the network and forward transactions and blocks do not bring much extra security (only robustness and a possibility of getting information from). However, economic nodes (the ones that create and receive transactions) do. Because they \ncan check whether miners cooperate and refuse to transact on an invalid chain. The only way to check if miners did not, say, add 1 BTC to the miner reward is to verify all transactions (because without verifying all transactions you don't how how much the fees are). And if miners created a code that adds them 1 BTC extra, the blocks will be invalid, economic users would ignore the invalid blocks and miners just created an altcoin (even if they had >51%). The economic full nodes keep miners at check. This security is impossible if everybody works on light nodes. You can wake up and find yourself in >21 million Bitcoin world and there is nothing you can do about it, you cannot even know which chain is normal and which is an \"extra coin Bitcoin\".  \n\n\n> All of this requires the trust in the LN hub.\n\nNo, the beauty of LN is that you don't have to trust anybody. The coins are still yours (minus opening/closing fees) when you open the channel, the counterparty cannot spend these coins without your consent. And you can close the channel anytime, immediately if the other party responds or after some predetermined time (the current default is 144 blocks) if the counterparty does not cooperate. \n\nThere are no LN tokens. The channel is simply, e.g. \"pay 100 to Alice and 100 to Bob after closing\" and if you (Alice) pay Bob 50, the channel will now show \"pay 50 to Alice and 150 to Bob after closing\". If you don't close, you can repeat it many times in both directions. If you not only spend but receive, you can have channels open indefinitely. \n\nIt's also interoprable. If Bob has a channel to Charlie, you can pay to Charlie via Bob. And so on. So the network does not fracture into Amazon coins and eBay coins, they are all the same coins. The only risk you have are opening/closing fee and 144 block freezing time if the counterparty is not cooperative. Receiving money in LN carries some risk but it can also be mitigated (it requires more explanation). \n\nThere is some censorship possibility but if you have many channels, there will be no way to censor all possible routes. \n\nThink about it just like Internet. My packets can go to you via many, many possible routes. You can try to censor it but it has to be a totalitarian/Great Wall of China type of censorship and even this is not completely leak proof.

This is a multidimensional problem: it's  disappearing nodes problem at one side, and disappearing small miners on the other. Moreover, we have tools to make the fees 1 sat/byte for now. Because we could squeeze at least 3 times more transactions into the blockchain if big services stopped the blockchain bloat. \n\nI have a 2 years old desktop machine that has Bitcoin Core installed  and I'm using it also for other tasks. My SSD is too small for the blockchain and I had to buy an extra HDD. When blocks come quicker than usual (it happens daily that there are 5 blocks within 10 minutes), my node starts to lag. I have to wait several minutes to catch up and during that time, the Bitcoin is unusable (you should not transact with old data). I plan to move it to a separate machine. I estimate that I will pay more in electricity during one year since I have to run a separate machine than I will pay with Bitcoin fees. With 8MB and current technology I would have to give up or buy extra RAM, large SSD and pay for a better internet connection and I'm not sure it will be enough.  \n\nAnd why should I pay these costs when serious blockchain users like many exchanges and merchants are extremely wasteful. Segwit usage is only at 10%. Segwit transactions are O(n^1) and are much faster to verify and there can be more of them in the block. \nAdditionally, I analyzed the blockchain and 30-50% of the inputs are unconfirmed (less than 6 blocks old). Most of these transactions (there are of course some other usage but one should not spend unconfirmed outputs that are not yours so this is not widespread) are a result of big services not batching transactions and doing a series of transactions creating change and subsequently spending this change, instead of doing multi output transactions. Sure, one would have to wait a bit with batching but some smaller exchanges are doing it and it's fine. And producing change and spending change is a wasted transaction, a blockchain bloat. Heck, 10% of inputs are from the same block so batching them requires 0 extra waiting. \n\nBlockchain bloat is an externality. Miners are compensated for their effort but full node users are not. Heavy blockchain users could save a lot of money for themselves and for others. Yet, they don't care. instead of fixing their inefficient bitcoin transaction engines, they prefer to just serve more users and profit from them.

I think you cannot still wrap your head around how it is possible. Opening a channel is a transaction to a multisignature address where you keep one key and the other party keeps the other. But before signing the transaction, you get a refund transaction (the closing transaction) that pays you back the balance (but valid only after 144 blocks). So you are always in control of the funds. LN transactions update these refund transactions. \n\nAs I wrote, sending in LN is completely risk free. The counterparty cannot get closing transaction that is above the current channel balance. Instead of keeping money in your wallet you can open a channel and treat it like the money you have (but 144 blocks in the future if the counterparty does not cooperate). I'm not sure if the current implementation allows it but it is possible to spend the balance from the channel (if done cooperatively) to make a regular blockchain transaction to a third party so you will only lose opening channel fees and the closing fee can be cannibalized. \n\n> I still do not understand where the LN TXs are stored or mined or how they can be verified.\n\nThey are not mined and they are stored by you and your channel counterparty. The LN transactions are updates to the channel closing transaction. This is not distributed.

Great majority of users use light wallets. Light wallets do not validate transactions and obtain only block headers and information about their coins. And light wallets are not as secure, there are many possible attacks against light wallets that are not possible against full nodes. Full node users provide something akin to \"herd immunity\" (the term from vaccinations where vaccinated people protect also non-vaccinated ones). If running full node is too expensive (and even now, I'm not sure I pay more in Bitcoin fees than in electricity for running the full node), there will be almost only light users. And light users are unaware if they make transactions on a correct chain. Without regular users that validate them, we start to need to trust the whales. And the whales might have different vision that regular Joes.\n\nAnd I have not even started with mining centralization that big blocks create. Before you start mining a new block, you have to validate all old transactions, otherwise you risk creating an invalid block.  Have you noticed that sometimes miners mine an empty block? It's because they haven't yet received full block and started mining just using the headers but they cannot add any transaction to it so they mine an empty block. If the blocks are larger it takes longer to propagate the blocks and large miners are in advantage because they have the old block (it's much more likely for a large miner to mine two consecutive blocks than for small miners). If the block reward gets halved and more reward is from the fees, it gets even stronger. And if large miners are rewarded more, mining gets centralized. \n\n> Once again I fail to see how this new complicated system has any advantage over BCH and its slow reasonable but verifiable low fee on chain scaling\n\nBCH provides zero innovation. BCH is actually meaningless knowing that, e.g. LTC exists. LTC is better than BCH (it has segwit, is LN-compatible, has faster blocks and has a different proof of work algorithm so LTC is not prone to \"a few BTC miners get bored and make a 51% attack on BCH\"). But neither can really support any type of blockchain scaling. Blockchain is a terribly inefficient way of making transactions, tens of thousands computers having the copy of the transactions doing a repetitive work with the transactions going hundreds of times around the world. And you add the mining (which is not needed if you have a trusted central party). It cannot physically scale unless we cut off the decentralization.  And then we have a copy of VISA and Mastercard. \n\n> So centralized and trusting there are no bad actors in either case.\n\nAgain, LN is not centralized and is completely trustless. \n\nI really don't know if LN is really going to take off. It requires a large network effect. LN is also not a solution to all problems. It is actually opposite of blockchain, LN allows arbitrary number of transactions but they cannot be of large value, whereas blockchain allows arbitrary value but limited number. But LN idea is as revolutionary as Bitcoin itself.

With 1 MB blocks, bitcoin has (had) a capacity of ~ 5 tx/s. Visa supposedly has an average rate of 2000 tx/s (with peaks in 56000!). And let's not forget Alipay was processing [256,000 payment transactions per second](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/11/12/2003682109) at peak in November 2017. That would mean bitcoin needs ~ 400 MB blocks in order to get to Visa's current average tx rate. In hard drive size, that's 20.5 terabyte of new blocks each year. And who knows how many orphaned blocks the miners with less than stellar network latency would face.What does this all lead to?

This encourages network splits, as not everyone will have the exact same time.\n- If you already know your address will come up in say 10 minutes, you have 10 minutes time to find a combination that will get you a good position in the next block. Adding proof of work will be either almost irrelevant for miners with better hardware, or too difficult for normal CPU users.\n- How do you fix nothing-at-stake without taking in the downsides of Casper as well?\n- It's easy to mess with the network time. Just set up 1000 AWS nodes and connect to as much people as you can. That way you can have more time for yourself to compute your next block and get more fees, or speed up if it's irrelevant for you so you can get a better block sooner and other miners get less fees.

Network-time is something that bitcoin itself already defines, and blocks must be time stamped close enough to network time to be accepted.\n\nNo I don't think thats so easy and we shouldn't relay on time syncing of milliseconds. But it is not just the time syncing. Think of this scenario. Lets say all nodes have exactly the same time (which is the optimal case and clearly not possible). There is still the problem that if node A creates a block and propagates it, it could need a few seconds till most of the other nodes get the information of node A. Now an intelligent full node could measure the following, lets assume that when a node propagates the block it needs in median x seconds till a node in the network gets the information of that block. Now I could generate a new block x seconds before I am allowed to and send it through the network. Since the median node gets it x seconds after my creation, the median node thinks it is valid and all nodes who get it later also think it is valid (since I took the median this are exactly half of the nodes which should be enough in theory to convince the whole system). Now x was clearly just a statistical value and strongly depends on the current network speed, therefore it vill vary a lot of times. But this will lead to a race who estimates the x better (since this is a big advantage) and therefore will lead to many small forks where around half of the nodes accepts a block and the other half not.

What you discussed is that the next miner order only depends deterministically from the hash of the last block, so we can model this as a function O(H), where H is the hash of the last block and O(H) is the miner order for the next block.\n\nI propose the following: We assume in the following that a hash is simply an integer value. Let H1, ..., H30 be the hashes of the last 30 blocks (H1 is the newest one of them and H30 the oldest one).

For example the last block (H1) only has 2 possible influence values either 0 or 1 (since its hash is calculated %2), therefore a miner can prepare 2 blocks with different hashes %2 and check which of the 2 blocks suits him better, but thats it, he does not have more influence regardless its computing power (in fact every full node regardless which hardware can compute such 2 blocks very fast and therefore the system is fair).\n\nThis proposal will effectively eliminate your worries in a)\n\nNow about b): Since the next miner order is depending on the hashes of the last 30 blocks we can simply say that we consider the amount of coins in an address 30 blocks ago and not the current amount, therefore miners can't influence their probabilities by moving coins to another address (since they would have to know 30 blocks before but 30 blocks before no relevant hashes are known).\n\nI hope I explained it understandably ^^. The number of 30 blocks can clearly be adjusted in my idea it was just the first number I thought about (its important to have enough \"randomness\" so I would say at least 30 blocks are good, but maybe more are better, for example for 30 blocks the number of different miner order possibilities equals 2^1 + 2^2 + ... 2^30 = 2^31 - 1 which is maybe too less)", 3], ["2018-01-25 10:13:40", "> people will try to mine as much coin as they can\n\nAddendum: as long as the cost of mining more coin is less than the value of that coin. \n\n> miners will definitely manipulate their blocks if that means whey will have some influence over next miner choice\n\nGiven my above addendum, this isn't necessarily true. Miners will definitely manipulate their blocks if the *cost* of manipulating those blocks is less than the gain they get by doing it. \n\nImagine that tens of thousands of people would participate in this process. This means that if the block time were say, 2 minutes, it would mean that a single active miner's address would come up in the progression every 2 minutes. For this thought experiment, let's assume everyone owns equal amounts of coin. Each active miner would have a 1/10,000th chance of mining each block. This means that without any PoW added in, it would already require a wily miner to construct 10,000 different blocks to find one where they're early enough in the progression to matter.\n\nBut let's add in some PoW. Let's say that a block is only valid if its hash is below a certain value, just like bitcoin. This multiplies the required hashes on top of that 10,000. If an average of 1 million hashes are necessary to complete the PoW, that means that 10 billion hashes would be required to find a profitable next block. It means that attacking this system would cost 10,000 times as much to attack as it does to mine. And if a higher percentage of people mine, its very likely there could be millions of people mining which would make the cost of an attack 10 million times as expensive as mining. The more people that use the system, the cheaper mining can become. Compare this to bitcoin, where the cost of attacking the system is basically 1:1 with the cost of mining. \n\nOne problem with this, i'm realizing, is that I'm not sure how you would determine the appropriate PoW difficulty. While in bitcoin, there's only one variable, the PoW difficulty, in PoTO there would be two variables, the PoW difficulty and the address progression difficulty. I'm not sure how you would determine an appropriate value for each variable separately. \n\nB doesn't apply since blocks do determine the choice for the next miner progression in my proposal.

If the target time is set to 60 seconds, then that means that on average an active mining node will come up once every minute.

Without POW you need 10 000 blocks you say. That's not true. Normally you should have 1 chance in 10 000 to find the next block. However, when you only create 1 other block your chances of getting the next block almost double, as you now have 2 blocks to choose from. Which I think is already bad. When you see it more practically you see that in Bitcoin it takes about 100ms to create a block. That's 1200 blocks in your proposed 2 minutes for a single CPU. In Bitcoin it's only needed 1 time, but if you want it more times you're going to take full CPU power to create those blocks. I'm pretty sure with some multicore processor and the right optimizations you can easily get it to 10 000. Which means an enormous advantage (as only 1 single extra block already gives you an advantage) on just a normal PC.  \nWhen you add PoW to it, you can't really make it so hard, so that it takes a minute for a normal CPU to process. Let's say you make it 10 seconds. The S9 ASIC is about 1 400 000 times faster in hashing than a good CPU. If we take 100ms as time to create a block, you need it to be 100 times faster in hashing than a CPU to make the PoW close to irrelevant.\n\nedit: I forgot you said you said it might be too difficult for CPU's, but the gist is the same. If you need 1 S9 miner to create a block in a timely manner, someone with 100 S9's will be able to pump out much more blocks and thus more advantage.\n \n> I proposed how in my OP.

So the last block only has 2 possibilities to influence the order of the miners. So before the last block gets mined there are 2 fixed possible mining orders (clearly the miner of the last block will compute 2 blocks, one for each mining order and take the better one of them, but everyone can do that, it doesn't need enormous computing power and is therefore \"fair\").\n\nYes in your proposal point b) does not apply since you let the mining order depend completely on the last hash.

So an intelligent miner of the last block will compute two blocks where the last digit of the hash of the first one ends with a 0 and the last digit of the hash of the second one ends with a 1.

In PoTO, the thing you can only produce once every block period (on avg) is an address that comes up in the mining address progression. \n\nSo let's say the next miner progression is based on something like the block from 60 blocks ago concatenated with the address that mined the block from 30 blocks ago. The only way for someone to have any predictable effect on the next miner progression would be:\n\n* If they could predict the *entire* set of addresses that will mine the next 60 blocks. In this case, they could grind on the block they're mining until they find one that will give them a higher probability on a block 60 blocks later. It seems unlikely that this could happen. But if it does, I can imagine that adding a PoW option alongside PoTO could add additional randomness that would break any ability to predict (say a normal PoW block with difficulty targeted at 15 times the block time of PoTO blocks so that one PoW block happens every 15 PoTO blocks on avg). If any PoW block in the last 30 blocks was also added into the equation to determine the next miner progression, this would block any predictability. \n* If their addresses comes up twice without other miners in between in the same miner progression. In this case, they could choose between mining with one address or another, doubling their chances of mining the block 30 blocks from now. This really only cuts the problem in half, where rather than someone who owns 50% of the active coins can mine 100% of the blocks, with this new idea, they could only mine 75%. But if we add that PoW option I mentioned in the previous point, a PoW block would also destroy this method of influence. \n\nI think whatever the ratio between PoW blocks to PoTO blocks would be the factor of how much cheaper this system is than pure PoW. So at 1 PoW block for every 15 PoTO blocks, this system would be 1/15th as expensive as bitcoin for the same level of security. We could easily make this 1/100th or 1/1000th if we upped those numbers (eg make the next progression depend on the block 4000 ago and the address 2000 ago, where a PoW block happens every 1000 PoTO blocks). \n\nThoughts?", 1], ["2018-01-26 07:38:09", "> A pool with 50% of cash would be able to monopolize mining.\n\nThat's a good point. And it is plausible that people would pool by creating multi-sig addresses that pool users send their money into. Not exactly a very enticing proposition, tho I imagine some people might do it.\n\nNow once you're talking 50%, you're already going to have problems no matter what system you're talking about.

It's always more profitable to centralize, on bitcoin it only over 50%. \n\nSolution would be to design picking process so that any miner doesn't have final decision who next/following miner is (even if he's has minuscule influence). Not sure how to do that though. Maybe have one miner create a seed that randomizes data-space but keep it private so that next miner doesn't know who he is picking. So, miner 1 would provide hash of it's seed, miner 2 wouldn't know who would be picked as miner 3 until miner 1 releases its seed so it can't cheat or anything, and miner 1 can release seed after miner 2 generates block when miner 3 would be known. Issue is miner might stop blocks if it doesn't releases its seed after block, but I guess then next candidate for miner can generate block instead and it's all good if he releases seed when needed. EDIT: this solution seems to suffer from same centralization problem, even under 51%. ", 1], ["2018-01-27 14:16:03", "So thinking about this more, the situation I proposed with PoW blocks as an option, would really make the miner progression entirely dependent on the PoW blocks rather than having any practical dependency on the PoTO blocks or miner addresses. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but makes a lot of the algorithm superfluous. \n\nI want to think through some of the math if the PoW option was removed in my last proposal. For an entity with 50% of the active coin ownership (active meaning they're online and waiting to mine), they would have a 50% chance of getting a block to mine, and then a 50% chance of getting an additional chance for the same block, which would give them a choice of two blocks - allowing them to double their chance for the next block (be it the actual next block, or a block 1000 blocks from now or whatever) which would give them a total of a 75% chance to mine any given block on average (1/2 x 1/2 + 1/2 x 1/2 x 2). For an entity with 25% of active coin ownership, this would be 1/4 chance to mine a block and 1/4 chance of the next opportunity for that block being them as well, giving them 31.25% change of mining any given block (1/4 x 3/4 + 1/4 x 1/4 x 2). For someone with 12.5% of active coin ownership, this gives them a 14% chance of mining the any given block. For 6.25% ownership, this gives a 6.64% chance. \n\nThis is a rapidly decreasing advantage as your portion of active ownership decreases. At 50% active ownership, you get a 50% advantage, but at 6.25% ownership, the advantage is only 6.24%. Because mining is basically costless, anyone can participate, even if they have a 50% disadvantage. This *might* keep mining individual (more of a lottery) and avoid centralization issues. One thing that could be done is to disallow multi-sig addresses from taking part in mining. This would exclude lightning channels, but would also exclude pools, which would be the only realistic way for people to gain these advantages (I really doubt people would be willing to trust their coins to a pool for the purposes of mining). \n\nBut you're right to be skeptical here. There are issues. I just don't know whether they're surmountable or not.\n\nIf we added in a component of urgency to mining, like there is in bitcoin (someone else can mine and publish a block at any time, so you better broadcast your block as soon as you mine it) then PoTO miners wouldn't be able to simply wait around in the case their address comes up twice in a row for a given block. One way to do this would be to have half the blocks mined by PoW. Of course, then the system is only half as costly (or twice as secure) as pure PoW, but it seems like it would work to plug that hole. \n\n> I don't see how using blocks way back in the past would help security though.\n\nThe idea of using a block that was way in the past was to make it so it would be computationally impossible to accurately predict the address progression for that number of blocks in the future. The idea of using an address in the past was to give time for an every-once-in-a-while PoW option to have time to happen. Given that the miner progression is basically always determined purely by the PoW blocks, I think you might be right that using past addresses (or any addresses) doesn't do much good. \n\n> How would you prove that?\n\nI'm imagining a block would be mined by aggregating transactions, adding a timestamp and the signature of the address you're mining with. Most basic (and space-costly) way of doing it would be to attach that duplicately mined block to the block you mine along with the signature of that miner (that was necessary to mine the block). Any block containing that extra stuff would be potentially twice as large, but hopefully it would happen so infrequently that it wouldn't matter. ", 1], ["2018-01-28 06:56:41", "What if the difficulty of PoW decreases if the avg time to find a PoTO block has passed? That way if some huge entity with like 25% of the active ownership finds a chance to mine two blocks and choose whichever is best for them, they have to worry about a PoW block almost definitely being propagated before that miner's next PoTO address range comes up? Eg if a PoW block is usually mined once every 1000 PoTO blocks , and PoTO blocks are mined once every minute, after a minute passes, a PoW block with 1/1000th or even 1/2000th the difficulty becomes valid so that a PoW block is just as likely or more likely to be mined before their second address comes up. \n\nThis way anyone who comes up in the address progression twice in a row would be risking losing the block entirely if they wait for their second choice. It would also allow the PoW actually done to be almost arbitrarily low (since PoW would basically only happen in edge cases), and thirdly, it would lower the variance of block times, since there would be a much higher probability of mining a block any given second after the target time.

Ideally, simple users and merchants will be indistinguishable from hubs.  Ideally, exchanges will use LN, so what happens will be like this:\n\n1.  You get some salary in fiat because your boss is old and doesn't understand this Bitcoin thing.\n2.  You buy BTC using fiat on an exchange and receive it on-Lightning.\n3.  You use Lightning to buy from a merchant.  Maybe via some hub, maybe via direct channel, maybe via a friend-of-a-friend.\n4.  Merchant sends BTC to exchange to get fiat, because local laws require that they pay taxes and salaries and suppliers in fiat.  Maybe directly to the exchange, maybe some hub, maybe via friend-of-a-friend.\n5.  Exchange keeps the BTC to sell it to you on your next paycheck.\n\nIt helps not to think in terms of \"simple users\" and \"merchants\".  Remember, every economic entity needs to earn funds somehow and to spend funds for supplies.  You earn funds via your salary and spend funds for food, shelter, and whatever little vices you have.  A business earns funds via their sales and spends funds on employees, subcontractors, suppliers, and whatever bribes are needed for the local government officials to  stop blocking economic activity.  The more those transfers can be done on-Lightning, the larger the number of channels per economic entity, the larger the capacity on those channels, and the longer the duration of those channels, regardless of what label you put to the nodes (\"simple user\", \"hub\", \"exchange\", \"merchant\", \"supplier\", \"manufacturer\"....).\n\nWhat we *can* model at this point is that there is likely to be a \"long tail\", i.e. a few nodes will have large numbers of channels while a large number of nodes will have a few channels, a few channels will have high capacity while a large number of channels will have low capacity, etc., since long tails happen in nature very often anyway.\n\n>How many channels each kind of user would have open at each time (e.g. \"On average, a simple user has 5 channels to merchants, 5 channels to other simple users, 2 channels to hubs. A merchant has 500 channels to simple users, 50 channels to merchants. ...\" ).\n\nUsers of any kind will be limited by how much they are willing to put on-Lightning.  How much users are willing to put on-Lightning will depend on how much Lightning is used.  The more Lightning is preferred by the economy, the more people will prefer to receive by Lightning, the more users will prefer to keep funds on-Lightning.\n\nChannels have a limit of 0.16777215 BTC.  If you have 0.5BTC you are willing to put on-Lightning, you need at least 3 channels.  Probably you'd put up 5 channels (100mBTC per channel), to various people.  Maybe to some hub, maybe to a friend, maybe to a merchant you regularly use.  Best is to pick a node that has low connectivity (because if a route terminates to that node, you are more likely to be selected as a routing node, since there are few channels to that node), which helps make the network more meshlike.\n\n>How much funding each kind of channel would have each way, in USD, and their duration (e.g. \"On average, each channel from simple user to a merchant might have $1000 fundiing upstream and $200 downstream, and will be used for 6 months before being closed. Each channel from merchant to merchant ...\").\n\nHow much funding will be, will depend, like I said before, on how much Lightning is preferred by people compared to the blockchain layer.\n\nDuration of channels will ideally be indefinite.  If you have money in the channel, you'd prefer to keep it open indefinitely, since as long as the channel is open, you can send on-Lightning with low fees.  If you have no money in the channel, you'd still prefer to keep it open indefinitely, since you can't lose anything on the channel (no money in it, remember?) and you have a chance it will be necessary for a route to go through you and let you earn money.\n\nThe only time anyone would close channels is if they need to make a big purchase beyond the Lightning limits, e.g. someone buying a house or car, or a business committing some funds for purchase of expensive equipment.  Otherwise if they can pay on-Lightning, they'd prefer to keep the funds on-Lightning.\n\n>What would the structure of the network (e.g. star-shaped with a single central hub, random net, etc.).\n\nIt is unlikely to be star-shaped as long as the base blockchain network doesn't centralize to the point that censorship is possible on the base blockchain.\n\nSuppose the topology is a star, with C as the center, and nodes Alice, Bob, and Davis connected to C.  If Alice and Bob decide they will have regular trade with each other they can open a channel between them, and C can do nothing since it is not involved, it's only between Alice, Bob, and the blockchain.  If Bob and Davis decide similarly, they can also open a channel between them.  Alice and Davis now have a choice: they can route to each other via C, or they can route via Bob.  C therefore cannot maintain its position as center, unless it severely undercuts routing fees; and if it undercuts routing fees below the point that it is profitable (C still has to consume electricity and Internet bandwidth, maintain the hardware running its node and pay for any breakdowns, and so on) then C remains central only until it runs out of money.\n\n>How many payments each kind of user would make (e.g. \"Per month, on average, each simple user will make 15 payments to merchants, for a total of $10000; 10 payment to other simple users, for a total of $5000. Each merchant will make 60 payment to other merchants, $100'000 total. ...\"\n\nDepends, again, on how much Lightning gets preferred.\n\n>How two generic users who do not share a channel would solve the routing problem: find a multi-hop path of payment channels and hubs that will carry a specified payment between them.\n\nThe Lightning BOLT 1.0 solution is to effectively share your map with everyone and for you to keep the map you get from everyone else.  Then you just use the A\\* pathfinding algorithm on the local copy of your map, which real-time strategy games have implemented for hundreds of units in time frames measured in milliseconds.\n\nThe above strategy can work maybe up to a hundred thousand nodes (i.e. about the size of a large RTS game map).  Beyond that, there's the FLARE protocol: http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/whitepaper_flare_an_approach_to_routing_in_lightning_network_7_7_2016.pdf\n\nIn FLARE basically you use some heuristics (i.e. you look at the local maps of nodes you know whose node identifier is \"close\" to your own node identifier, for some mathematically random definition of \"close\") to get a subset of the global map.  If the destination is within your subset, just route directly as is usual.  If the destination is not within your subset, you and the destination share compact representations of your subset maps and see if there is some set of nodes common between them: if there are, the destination provides a route from those nodes to them, and you look for a route from yourself to the intermediate nodes.  If that still fails, both you and the destination start growing your local subsets by loosening the heuristics (up until one or both of you run out of resources, in which case you have a routing failure), then try again until you succeed in finding each other or you succeed in finding intermediate nodes.\n\n>How often each kind of user will be online and connected to the LN;\n\nIdeally 24/7.  By keeping connected 24/7 you not only can stay vigilant of any theft attempts online, you also have the opportunity to earn via routes.\n\nThis is not so onerous.  One thing I'm planning to work on is a \"Lightning Box\" appliance: effectively a single-board computer with low power consumption running a lightweight LN node 24/7.  You install it in your home and physically secure it (because theft of the appliance can lead to theft of the funds, it contains the keys after all).  You connect your mobile device to the Lightning Box on mobile data/Internet in order to spend from your Lightning Box.  Your mobile device doesn't have to be permanently connected, just your Lightning Box.  Yes, it's the beginning of those \"house computers\" you sometimes see in science fiction.  \"Lightning Box, pay the grocer for some tomatoes at high-priority delivery please, I want a salsa\" \"You know I can't do that, Dave\" \"sudo make me salsa\" <the Lightning Box zaps you and you become salsa>.\n\n>How much the hubs, Watchers, and routing servers will charge for their services;\n\nJust slightly above the cost; go look up \"marginal cost\" and \"marginal revenue\".\n\n>What will be the typical transaction fee for channel opening and closing transactions, and the maximum confirmation delay that it may suffer.\n\nDepends on how much Lightning is preferred.  If Lightning is preferred then very few people will use the blockchain and open and closing and confirmation delay will be low.", 6], ["2017-12-05 02:50:38", "We literally don't know.\n\nMy guess is that it will be payment providers will be a thing; as payment channels need money to be started, and the merchant side of things will be either unrealistically expensive(how many businesses have an entire month or even a week's revenue on hand?) or they are effectively taking out a loan, extremely low risk loan as they can't spend a cent of it, but a loan all the same.\n\nAt which point consumers become resources to help balance channels without a reset transaction and they can fund their own channels as they are smaller.\n\n-----------\n\nSo in my mind, we will see super nodes emerge that have the ability to fund merchant channels, perhaps even advertise to them and make hardware; that sort of thing; while users fund their own channels and connect to these services because on the user side of things its completely free.\n\nThese super node's will likely setup a subsystem between themselves, as we see with every system; while the pure lighten network stays niche because sub satoshi fee's is slightly to expensive for the privacy that it will give.

The fees are going to be small but the fee structure is going to be different than in regular Bitcoin blockchain.

The fees for opening and closing the channel will be just regular Bitcoin fees for a few hundred bytes transactions each. You will be able to do multi-hop transactions by sending a query to your partners (and they can send queries to their partners, etc.) but how it is going to work in practice remains to be seen. The longer the chain, the larger the chance of a failure. \n\nThe LN is designed for microtransactions. Current draft of the LN protocol specifies even  the maximum value of the channel as 0.1677 BTC.

A couple of things it feels worth saying though:\n\n- LN will enable true micropayments, eg satoshis.  It's not clear exactly what uses there might be for such tiny amounts, but if they are used (which I suppose I'd expect), you might get millions of transactions per user.\n\n- It occurred to me that infrastructure channels (eg between hubs) might be relatively narrow.  This is because a) the bigger the channel the more bitcoin must be locked up, and b) if there's enough liquidity (i.e. traffic coming the other way), and each transaction is effectively instant, payments could presumably be divided into tiny fractions, and a relatively large amount could be squeezed through a relatively small channel. \n\n- Seems to me the costs are likely to be dominated by the 'cost of capital' - that is, what you have to pay for hubs to lock up their bitcoin in the channels.  In the wider economy this is typically ~10% pa.  So a 1BTC channel would cost 0.1 BTC pa at that rate.  It then depends how many transactions are made, which will give you the cost per tx.  It could be very low indeed for major hubs processing very large numbers of transactions *in both directions*. \n\n- Someone please correct me if I've got this wrong, but (ignoring the opening and closing), the biggest cost per tx will likely be for the 'last mile'.  That is, the payment channel to an individual user.

One of them is a catalyst for things people generally agree are productive on average such as startups, student loans, etc.  One of them does not provide a useful function to society.  (I find this to be a strong counterargument to one of PoS's supposed benefits of wasting less than PoW, although for them to be exactly equal I guess you need a perfectly fair emissions tax?)\n\nAlthough I guess bitcoin right now is something like a startup, where investors take on risk in exchange for the perceived expected positive net value to the rest of society of bitcoin getting over the burden of adoption after which it provides a useful public service.  Regarding OP, businesses have no incentive to start accepting bitcoins _unless_ speculators are creating demand for bitcoins (as the profit available from bitcoin commerce is limited by the purchasing power of said bitcoins).  I know of three cases where bitcoin commerce is incentivized for both parties: transactions where fiat is problematic, Antminers, and transactions where the vendor of goods and services offers a better price in bitcoin than in fiat because they themselves are speculators and would prefer to get bitcoins without paying exchange fees.  The first pretty much exists regardless, the second only has demand because of speculation, and the third is also a direct consequence of \"greed\".\n\nThat being said, I assume we're talking about the long term.  If/when there is ubiquitous adoption, hodling will no longer have the same proprerties.  I would expect the purchasing power of held bitcoins to only grow approximately proportionally to the productivity of society - in other words, somewhat slower than fiat inflation, and especially slower than lending.  (Assuming no bitcoins are lost.  In practice, I guess bitcoin's deflationary properties do to some extent punish hodlers and reward borrowers because the risk of losing keys is unevenly distributed, but almost certainly less so than fiat inflation does.)\n\nSo I think when talking about the hypothetical bitcointopic future it makes more sense to compare bitcoin loans to fiat loans.  Even if bitcoin somehow kills fiat completely, there will for sure be such regularly used constructs as bitcoin loans, ~~bitconnect~~ bitcoin banks that pay interest, trusted fractional reserve imaginary bitcoins, bailouts for bitcoin banks where the government socializes the cost by just taxing citizens since they can't print money, etc.  (I wonder if something like [Bloom](https://hellobloom.io/) could be an interesting alternative to the irresponsible-borrowing-predatory-lending-federal-bailout cycle, if it lead to a decentralized market for loans where bad actors suffer the costs by themselves.  That being said I have not looked at it much and have no idea if it is even close to actually working in practice...)\n\nAnyway, suppose fiat inflates at 5%, and bitcoin's supply stays approximately constant.  This means all other things being equal (including volatility), a fiat loan that pays 10% is pretty much the same reward for both parties as a bitcoin loan that pays 5%.  But the risk to the lender is higher in the bitcoin case (they stand to lose 100% compared to hodling in case of default, but with fiat they stand to lose 95.2% compared to hodling in terms of purchasing power).  So as I understand it inflation encourages people to agree on interest rates and similarly encourages investing.\n\nAs far as I can tell, aside from purely psychological effects (e.g. people badly want to get rid of inflationary fiat shitcoins, people feel happy when they get a fiat \"raise\", but not so happy when their bitcoin salary goes \"down\", etc.), inflation essentially allows the government/miners to exclusively tax unproductive hodlers, which is a different operation than say income tax, which taxes the most \"productive\" members of society.  In this sense, I wonder if those hypothetical bitcoin bank bailouts might actually be worse than fiat bank bailouts.  The government is going to find a way to take your money to pay for it no matter what, but printing money seems to me like one of the better ways of doing it.  \n\n> As I can imagine it, it just seems that our economy would become geared to more critical/useful directions, because we're spending less money on stuff we don't really need, but more on things that are really important (I acknowledge that this might be entirely wishful thinking...).\n\nThe unstated assumption is that an inflationary economy encourages mindless consumerism.  Is this really true?  I would think mindless consumerism is much more a consequence of culture and mass media than of inflationary currency.  I agree that inflation encourages dumping your shitcoins.  But there are two ways to get rid of your excess shitcoins after taking care of necessities: buying shitgoods and shitservices, or lending shitcoins to people who need shitcoins.  Anyone who can decide to hodl some bitcoins can surely also decide to lend shitcoins at high interest.  And hodling is just as useless to society as buying shitgoods and shitservices, if not more.  So I think the more relevant property of a working economic system that you can point to is how much it encourages productive lending.  \n\nBitcoin's emission curve is useful for adoption, but I am highly skeptical if it is actually a good thing after that.

Insider trading only works if you have foreknowledge of an event that is likely to trigger a price rise or price fall regardless of what you do.

Anyone can do this with enough money. \n\n\n>how did they actually use information in their possession to inflate price, and how could they benefit from that?\n\nSee above. They benefit from it by buying BCH moments before CB drops its support on the market much earlier than they said they would (it was pretty sudden and unexpected)\n\n\n>if they dumped some of their BCH, how could they find buyers for their inflated-priced orders?\n\nThis I am not sure of, as CB itself stopped taking orders (not sure if they ever took any actually).

All the **few** legitimate sellers get their orders completed which then leaves this theatre of fake buyers buying in at $9500 but in the end no money is really being lost as they all work for the same team.\n\nLets say this goes on for a short while, just long enough for this high price to register on various platforms such as CoinMarketCap to make it look like the price is skyrocketing.  Participants at other exchanges take notice and subsequently the price starts moving up globally...  GDAX then halts trading at $9500 until 9am the next day causing much fear, uncertainty and doubt...\n\nThis scenario is not insider trading but it is market manipulation.  The problem here is that the red team should not have been able to do this if the market was \"liquid\" (meaning there would have been enough sellers that a $9500 price would never have been hit).  The fact Coinbase covertly opened this market without fair warning and then allowed a halt to occur at that ludicrous price could, by some (many?), be considered criminal.  \n\n* **how did they actually use information in their possession to inflate price, and how could they benefit from that?**\n\nIn my mind the red team didn't need insider information to carry this out.  Everyone knew that the BCH market was opening before Jan 1, the red team knew the existing GDAX API and could have coded these buys/sells in advanced.  A simple script could have been used to keep an eye on the Coinbase site to alert the red team to go into action.  They profit by making the market for BCH move up by billions of dollars.\n\n* **if they dumped some of their BCH, how could they find buyers for their inflated-priced orders?**\n\nManipulative buyers/sellers with deep pockets were on the same team and there were not enough legitimate sellers to keep the price legit.\n\n* **why Core supporters got pissed off?**\n\nI'LL TELL YOU WHY I'M PISSED OFF!!!  \n\nIn my mind BCH is either Bitcoin Corporate or Bitcoin China, and they don't care for Bitcoin being in the power of developers and they don't care about decentralization, scalability and maintainability.  \n\nThey have money, power, connections and an army of socket puppets.  These sock puppets came out of nowhere claiming how great Bitcoin Cash was because it has those big blocks and low fees.  This song and dance has been played before and they're called alt-coins.  I can use Dogecoin to transfer a billion DOGE with a fee of a few pennies.  It's so easy to generate an altcoin now that you can go to a website to and reconfigure that block size parameter and upload your new icons and artwork to generate your own version of Bitcoin Cash.  If you do that, please call it Bitcoin Crash, or Bitcoin Corporate, or Bitcoin China, or Bitchcoin, or Ver Bitcoin.  At least we'll know your motives.\n\nAnd I'm also pissed off at Coinbase because the markets are about **PERCEPTION** and they were either extremely negligent, stupid, or genius.  I realize there's much stupidity in the world but the way this was played out was sheer genius and is making someone very rich at the cost of others.  This type of shit doesn't happen accidentally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", 2], ["2017-12-21 12:36:35", "I think it's a bit early to know for sure.

I hadn't really fully appreciated how the UTXO model was subtly combating this sort of thing in Bitcoin until I looked into the account-based alternative firsthand.\n\nWith that said, it's worth noting that many of the Ethereum powers-that-be are enthusiastically looking into zero-knowledge stuff that will (in theory) be able to help with or mitigate the privacy losses incurred by the underlying account-based model (at least on an opt-in basis). \n\nHowever, Wuille, per usual, hits the nail on the head when he brings in the all-important \"i\" word: *incentives*. One of the most common arguments heard from the pro-Monero crowd is that \"if privacy isn't mandatory (baked in to the protocol) or at least *the default*, the whole network suffers a loss of fungibility, because 'Everyday Joe' users can't really be expected to go out of their way to privatize their transactions.\" This is an interesting argument, and if it does have any merit, Ethereum's account model will still be quite bad for privacy and fungibility, even if they do manage to incorporate zero-knowledge magic in useful ways.\n\nFinally, with regards to Bitcoin (and that magical \"i\" word), I'm personally extremely excited for the potential synergy that Schnorr and CoinJoin could offer... as [Aaron van Wirdum put it](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496/):\n\n>CoinJoin is not a new concept. But up until now CoinJoin was typically a bit of a hassle. As such, most people don't bother. And since most people don't bother, those who do bother could automatically be marked as suspicious; potentially defeating the purpose of using CoinJoin in the first place.\n\n>But Schnorr signatures can add a new advantage to CoinJoin. It enables all participants in a CoinJoin transaction to not only combine their transactions, but to also combine their signatures. And doing so means the size of the transaction would actually be smaller than all individual transactions combined.

If we were to change the PoW anytime, the result would be a chain that is extremely insecure and easy to attack in comparison to the present chain.\n\nYes. It is a nuclear option. But in contrast to mutual assured destruction (MAD) doctrine, the PoW change is survivable. The chain would be badly damaged but with strong community, the value would be enough to find other miners. There are a lot of hashrate on many crypto algorithms that would switch to mining bitcoin if it is profitable. The threat of the PoW change is the Bitcoin MAD, the ultimate protection against a 51% attack. Of course I'm talking about 51% within the Bitcoin rules. An \"inflacoin attack\" can be defended with just having full nodes that reject inflacoins. \n\n> The most reliable deterrent against a 51% attack or an unwanted hard-fork is that miners will always find it more profitable to stay \"honest\" \n\nI agree. There is will probably never be a successful 51% attack for profit (I don't know maybe with heavy BTC shorting there may be some way) but I'm talking about a 51% attack in order to just create a complete and utter destruction. I don't know, from a competitor, bankers, governments? The PoW is the final protection against it. They may temporarily weaken Bitcoin but they won't be able to kill it.\n\nAnyway, I think the biggest threat to Bitcoin is not technical but social. Inflacoin will not be created by some clever technical attack but by social engineering. This  has always been cheaper than brute force attack. There will be months of propaganda that \"inflation is good\". There will be millions of sock puppet accounts that will repeat this message. The fork will promise \"cheaper fees, \"faster confirmations\", \"long-term viability\", and \"mining stability\". Essentially, \"Win-win for everybody\".   And initially, it will be cheaper. And many people will fall for that. ", 2], ["2017-12-26 05:59:39", "Yes, it is possible but not now.

It cannot reject inflacoins or wish them out of existence. Finally, it'll be the market (businesses and users transacting the coins) that chooses one chain over the other. They won't need a node to do a transaction. Even if there are 10,000 nodes running old-Bitcoin nodes and only 100 running inflacoin nodes, if more people choose to transact in inflacoin - inflacoin wins.\n\nI also find it difficult to imagine that Bitcoin could survive a PoW change. A new emergency PoW would cause lots of unstability and risk. In all likelihood, you'd see all major exchanges and businesses preferring the more stable coin. The original miners would keep mining the original chain and could legitimately claim that it was Bitcoin and the chain with the new PoW was an attack by a small group of users, and they'd end up winning too.\n\n> I'm talking about a 51% attack in order to just create a complete and utter destruction.

Other branches would only be used\nwhere some participant is failing to cooperate. More strongly stated,\nI believe that *any* contract with a fixed finite participant set\nupfront can be and should be represented as an OR between an N-of-N\nand whatever more complex contract you might want to represent.\n\nIn other words, the \"monotone function\" is a \"base case\" for any contract involving a predetermined number of participants, which is essentially: \"if there is unanimous agreement, authorize expenditure\".\n\nThe improvement that *Graft*root describes is allowing the contract's *other* \"spend-possibilities\" to be authorized by certain participants (via pre-signed \"surrogate scripts\") in case they are offline, uncooperative, or otherwise unavailable later on, while only incurring a maximum of 32-bytes of additional overhead for this feature (which is only incurred when the base case fails i.e. when one of the parties is unavailable and a surrogate script needs to be used instead). Of course, this uses the magic of Schnorr signatures to be so efficiently aggregable. \n\nFrom the email: \n\n>Summarizing:   A coin's authorizing contract is decomposed into a top\nlevel OR between a monotone function of pubkeys (such as N of N) and\nany number of arbitrary surrogate scripts which are acceptable\nauthorizations.  A key aggregate (see [2]) is formed, and is used to\nsign each of the the surrogates.  Participants save these signatures.\nLater, when it comes time to spend the coin, if the pubkey holders are\nunwilling or unavailable, the spender presents and satisfies the\nrelevant surrogate along with it's signature R-value and\nnon-interactively aggregates the S-value into the transaction's\noverall aggregate signature.  The result is 0-overhead if the signers\ncooperate, or ~32-byte overhead (plus the script) if they don't.  This\navoids the log() overhead of tree based schemes, and allows delegation\nto take place before or after the fact but requires storage.  The\npotential for unexpected surrogate replay if keys are reused in\nfoolish ways also needs to be kept in mind, though it may be somewhat\nmitigated by aggregation.

Bitcoin so far has been the most successful and widely used, but until a scaling solution is fully adopted the blockchain cannot reasonably handle that type of volume of transactions without risking its decentralization. \n\nSecond, the adoption of a new technology typically takes place in the form of an s-curve - spanning a length of time anywhere from 5 to 20 years on average. This means the value of the new tech goes parabolic until we\u2019ve reached a large enough level of permeation in society to make the gradual change towards logarithmic. \n\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s fairly safe to hypothesize that during the parabolic stage of the s-curve (which I believe we\u2019ve only just now entered) the volatility in price will be great. As society adopts bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) their prices will stabilize and the volatility will diminish substantially. As liquidity increases, volatility decreases. Liquidity is directly correlated with price. \n\nThis will make it much easier and safer on users when widespread adoption occurs and we want to use our crypto to make everyday purchases for goods and services. \n\nI once watched an Andreas Antonopoulos talk on YouTube wherein he hypothesized that the full adoption of bitcoin might take about 15 years. Considering our society is already well integrated with the internet, and bitcoin itself being just another layer on top of the internet, I believe this is a pretty reasonable guess. \n\nWe\u2019ve used a solid 9 of those years so far and are currently experiencing growth that we\u2019ve never seen before in history.

[Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes) dismissed this idea since it operated only in the manner of being bad money driving out good money (See: [Gresham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law)). Gesell's solution dealt with money as a *medium of exchange* and was perfect in that respect, but that respect alone. Having something that was a superior *medium of exchange* meant nothing if it also didn't have any purpose as a *store of value*. People would use something or anything else as a *store of value*, meaning that Gesell's \"perfect money\" would simply exist, entirely unused. That said, it was never actually tried.\n\nFreicoin has *mostly* survived this current interest in alts without any major increase in price. That said, I'm a bit worried that if people find out about it, it'll see a large increase in interest, only to have the fact that it is a purposely redistributing coin (from its users to the miners) cause it to bubble and then burst as well. It is possible it could see interest without any major impact on its price, however, so long as users are fully aware that when they buy it, they are buying it knowing they will have their coins demurred. Upon realizing this, those same users will simply go back to currencies that are superior stores of value.\n\nI would love to see Freicoin become a more popular altcoin (Note: I presently own absolutely none myself and do not advocate that people purchase it). The biggest complaint I have about Freicoin, however, is that a large amount of the early coin was basically pre-mined for foundation setup. While it has been demurraged, that's little consolation. Pre-mines are what prevent me from showing any interest in a coin, because pre-mines are ways of subsidizing interest at the expense of natural growth. To me, a coin should only grow at a natural rate, based on user interest and not on subsidized support.\n\nIf someone made a Freicoin based on a different proof-of-work than what Bitcoin uses (like maybe scrypt?) **and** did not do any premine of it **and** picked a more reasonable 2% demurrage, I would highly consider it as something worth trying.\n\nEDIT: Fixed some past/present tense issues, formatting, added a few links.", 2], ["2017-12-12 22:03:27", "I believe the popular argument states that the price fluctuation will stabilize when there is enough buy-in that the supply and demand begin to equalize.

So it assumes this recent spike in bitcoin value has meant a recent spike in electricity use. That's absolutely not the case. This recent spike in value has meant that mining companies can now put a much greater percentage of their revenue into buying more and newer mining machines. These additional new machines will use more and more electricity as they come online, but will be much more efficient than the analysis suggests. Probably most of the new mining revenue from bitcoin's price growth is going not toward electricity but to replacing old mining rigs with the brand new Antminers. This makes a massive difference in electricity estimates because the new S9s have a way more efficient hash rate per kWh than the report linked above assumes for the average mining rig.\n\nI'm getting this from a competing report I read (that I now cannot find in my history) but it goes like this: the total hash power of all mining machines is known to us. If all the hash power right now was being generated by the latest Antminer S9 -- which it isn't, but certainly all growth in hash power in the last year has come from the S9s and it is in the economic best interest of EVERY miner to upgrade old machines given that S9s generate much more hash power for nearly the same electricity cost -- then the actual electricity use of bitcoin mining is about 1000x less than what the report quoted above suggests.\n\nIf this gets enough upvotes, I'll try again to find that competing report, but maybe someone else has a link?\n\nEdit: [Here's the PDF to the competing report.](http://ro.gerwil.co/wp-content/uploads/Roger-Wilco-Agency-Report-Is-Bitcoin-Mining-an-Ecological-Disaster-v3.1.pdf)\n\nIt says: \n>\"If you take the global hash rate, and divide it by the hash-rate of an S9, you come up with 557,142, which is roughly the number of AntMiner' S9's it would take to run the global Bitcoin blockchain.\n\n>\"That means, globally and every month, the blockchain network is using around 559 million kWh, or around several orders of magnitude less than the report by Digiconomist and Vice (who, as you may recall, said that Bitcoin used around 2 TRILLION kWh per month).\n\n>\"But what of heating and cooling?

If the blockchain were run by a full network of S9s (which it's not, but it is in the financial best interest of every miner to upgrade to S9s), the electricity use would be 1.2 billion kWh/month (doubling his 559 million estimate to account for cooling), where as Digiconomist predicts an electricity use of 2 trillion kWh/month", 11], ["2017-12-11 15:32:34", "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-07/bitcoin-is-greener-than-its-critics-think#footnote-1512668309251\n\nI like this quote from the article: \"It\u2019s easy to criticize bitcoin for being wasteful.

Even with worst case scenario estimates, they're still less than 1% of global energy use at present. They're using a LOT of energy, but they're not really contributing significantly to the demand on the price of energy in your supply/demand equation.\n\nIt's easy to point to bitcoin as using a lot of energy because it seems wasted, but in the grand scheme of things, it is less than 1% of US consumption of energy annually. Secondly, cheap energy means that the capacity is underutilized. In the power industry, we literally scale the amount of electricity being generated with a buffer capacity for sudden spikes in usage, but power at night can be negotiated to be very very cheap, compared to power during say, mid day on a June weekday when consumption is at its max. If the price of electricity isn't rising, that means it is literally having no effect on the actual energy consumption. It's like getting on a diesel bus... no matter if you are 50 pounds or 500 pounds, your affect on the engine load is negligible. \n\n> By the time miners have to stop mining because energy goes up in price (rather than bitcoin coming down in price), their energy use will already have contributed far too much green houses gas into the atmosphere.\n\nKeynesian based, inflation driven economies produce far more greenhouse gases than bitcoin could ever dream to. Our economies are engineered so that your money withers away, so you either need to park it into the stock market in a company that is producing some goods or services (which all use energy), or spend it on one of those products from said companies so that their earnings continue to climb. Visit a manufacturing facility sometime, and look at the amount of useless shit they are pumping out, and I 100% guarantee those machines dwarf any consumption of electricity by a miner. Hell, the transportation costs to move a load of \"Hello Elmo\" stuffed animals (read useless junk) through its distribution channels dwarf a bitcoin miner usage.\n\nIt's a mistake to think that bitcoin mining power goes to waste. Bitcoin mining power gets converted to an economical bond of trust, and that trust is what is going to allow us to have a much more natural economy again, that doesn't rape the earth to produce more and more useless junk in the name of ever more earnings to keep the stock market climbing. When people can save effectively and spend on necessities and occasional entertainment items, you will see these affects. \n\n> 2) When has economics ever helped contain environmental impact? Environmental destruction and climate change have almost no effect on the quarterly profit reports of mining companies. Our current system places no measurable cost on using up our finite resources -- like clean air and topsoil -- until it reaches a disastrous tipping point.\n\n> I appreciate your analysis, but the free market has been historically terrible at mitigating environmental tragedy. \n\nThis is largely incorrect. In fact, market economics is precisely why we consume so many fossil fuels today. Subsidies offered to oil and previously coal made for it to be the cheapest and effect fuels, and we saw a proliferation of its infrastructure pop up accordingly. When coal subsidies were not only cut, but taxes were applied to coal usage, the market adapted astonishingly well. Coal is dead. It isn't coming back. \n\nI have personally been to many power plants where they were literally converting what had been a coal plant for 80 years, to a natural gas plant. There are currently 3 iirc major LNG facility construction projects in the gulf coast going on at the moment with more being planned. There's a shortage of tankers to transport LNG to china, who is also investing heavily in natural gas power generation. Natural gas by the way has half as much carbon output per BTU as coal, and no ash, and with a proper SCR setup, can result in byproducts of only CO2 H2O and N2. This is all a direct result of aligning economic incentives with the goal of reducing carbon output. Converting from coal to natural gas is a massive capex project, and you don't just go back. If coal dropped to record lows tomorrow, new infrastructure may be built for coal again, but all the existing infrastructure now outfitted for natural gas would simply remain on natural gas. If you convert your car from octane to diesel, you don't go back to octane when the prices drop. \n\nAnd finally, a perfect example on the show of economic incentives' place in a market economy, you can look at nuclear. After Fukushima, people panicked, and both oil and gas lobbyists *and solar/hydro lobbyists* pounced on that fear and pushed for regulation in the name of safety, to price nuclear out of the market. The amount of oversight is so ridiculous, that it simply isn't cost feasible to invest in it. True story, I once had a door slammed on my hand, and as with all incidents in my line of work it needed to be reported. The project site promptly shut down for an hour long demonstration on how to properly operate a door, the importance on finger placement, and safety protocols. Hundreds of highly paid professionals sitting around rolling their eyes because I had a judgment lapse. How much did that hour cost? A lot. \n\nConsequently, Westinghouse just declared bankruptcy a while back and almost took toshiba down with it. 1 of the 2 recent nuclear sites in construction was recently shut down due to cost overruns and the remaining one is barely break even at this point, and I believe will shut down before finishing as well.\n\nBut this is all in the name of safety right? Surely we don't want to mess around with safety and nuclear... Except for the NAVY has been using nuclear propulsion for over 50 years now without incident. Most of the due diligence at nuclear construction sites comes in the form of hand written signatures  and initials on paperwork that will never see the light of day again, and I could sign something Mickey Mouse and no one would blink an eye. But all of this is legally required because of some law somewhere. It's simply not cost effective. \n\nSo what you perceive of a failure in the free market is actually the free market doing its job particularly well in chasing economic incentives, and avoiding non economically efficient options. The problem isn't the free market. The problem is the incentives are not aligned with the goal of reducing carbon output and are instead aligned with lining people's pockets. Fix the incentives and you fix the climate change problem. \n\nAlso, with prolific nuclear, bitcoin mining consumption becomes effectively a non issue.

The numbers don't support it. Not at a decentralized scale. Even at a centralized scale, there's a hard upper limit to block sizes.

If we add trust to the system (node service providers), then we lose the advantages and there's no real reason to even continue in a blockchain manner. Electronic money alone is not very interesting. Especially money that is easily traceable, will always have some level of fee, and isn't confirmed irreversible until 30 minutes later.

I can agree to your point that a network will be healthier if there are more more full nodes, that is true. \n\nHowever, I would like reiterate the point that there would be a larger number of nodes if more people are using the network, and more people will only be using the network if it is easy to use and if transaction times and fees are predictable and reliable. \n\nLet's say in Scenario 1 there are 1,000 people using the network with 50% of them running full nodes, i.e. 500 full nodes, and; in Scenario 2 there are 10,000 people using the network with 10% running full nodes, i.e. 1,000 full nodes. Wouldn't Scenario 2 be a lot more resistant against 51% miner attacks?\n\n(Also, a 51% attack isn't really practically feasible as it would bring the miner little to no gain by doing so. Firstly, it would require a LOT of investment to carry out something like that! And even if someone did that, I believe a miner would end up losing more money than they could gain if they ever tried a 51% attack as Bitcoin will start losing all it's value in the market as soon as the network has been compromised, wouldn't it? The extra amount of coins they generate would merely end up being absolutely worthless. It's in every miner's best interests to keep the Bitcoin network healthy because otherwise the coins they generate will have no value. An economically rational actor would have no incentive to carry out such an attack.)\n\nAlso, what would be the increase in the cost of running a node by increasing block size limit from 1 MB to 8MB? Would it be a 1% increase or 5% or 20% or a 100% increase? If it's very low, then a blocksize increase wouldn't really have an effect on the number of full nodes, would it? A minor blocksize increase should have zero to no effect on electricity costs.\n\n> No point in moving your funds to Bitcoin if someone with enough hashpower can inflate it too, that's the problem you're trying to avoid anyway.\n\nWhen you have a collapsing economy like that people will only see what is the most stable and easiest way to store their wealth at that immediate moment. No one is going to worry about a 51% miner attack way off in the future before making their decisions (which is not really a very high concern with Bitcoin anyway!)\n\nAgain, I don't see what larger block sizes have to do with running a full node on a Raspberry Pi. Would a blocksize increase to 2MB or 8MB really make it impossible to run them on a Pi (with low electricity costs)? The only thing that would be needed would be a bit more storage. 1TB or 2TB hard-drives aren't really all that expensive (especially when considering that you'd need them to store the 1MB blockchain anyway).\n\n>...even modest blocksize increases lead to massive reductions in number of fullnodes.\n\nA source on that will be helpful.\n\nAlso, what does running a full node have to do with resisting government snooping?

A minor blocksize increase should have zero to no effect on electricity costs.\n\nI'm not qualified to say that; all I know is that it's possible to publish on-chain particularly nasty blocks with a single block-sized transaction that involves a large number of signature operations.  The load of such a worst-case attack block would be quadratic on the size of blocks (i.e. the quadratic sighash bug): 2x means a 4x increase in CPU and memory, 4x means a 16x increase in CPU and memory, etc..  This is fixed in SegWit as sighash operations under SegWit are different and do not trigger the quadratic sighash bug, but legacy transactions (which still trigger the bug, and cannot be changed without a hardfork due to consensus compatibility) are limited to 1Mb.\n\nNow that is a worstcase bug and it would be possible to limit quadratic-sighash bug problems by imposing a transaction size limit, but in any case my understanding is that developers are concerned that other similar bugs may be found that are quadratic on the block size limit, hence the caution with which the SegWit block size increase was done.\n\nIn any case, block size increases are proportional to fullnode deployment decreases, and if we factor in adoption, the proportion of fullnodes to users has dropped much faster than the block size increase.\n\nIn short: my understanding is that luke-jr's data suggests that this intuition does not hold in the actual experience of Bitcoin.\n\n>No one is going to worry about a 51% miner attack way off in the future before making their decisions\n\nThe problem is precisely this (\"who cares about the future?\" thinking).\n\nLet me propose this hardfork: an \"economic majority-activated inflation control\".  You can set a bit in your transaction, and that bit indicates whether you allow inflation or not.  How is the inflation implemented?  If you set the inflation-allowed bit, your transaction fee is treated as double of what the transaction fee paid (i.e. the miner gets 2x the fee you paid).  If you don't set the inflation-allowed bit, your transaction is in legacy mode and the transaction fee received by the miner is exactly what you paid.\n\nThis of course lets the economic majority control inflation, so miners are unable to impose inflation here, right?  If everyone sets the inflation-allowed bit, that's the will of the economic majority, right?\n\nExcept of course everyone will set the inflation-allowed bit.  If you do, you get an immediate 50% discount on fees.  If you don't, you will still suffer from inflation (because it affects everyone in proportion to their HODLings) regardless.  If you're partying and spending your last Bitcoin on hookers and blow because you're gonna die tomorrow, by golly you'd set the inflation-allowed bit.  Who cares about the future?\n\nThis is what we call an \"externalization\".  The cost of fees is still being paid.  It's just that in this hypothetical \"economic majority activated inflation\" hardfork, it's not being paid by the people who make the transaction: the cost is socialized to all HODLers.\n\nFees will be paid regardless of whether individual transactions have a tiny fee or a large fee.  Under the current Bitcoin network with large numbers of fullnodes, a blocksize increase is paid for by fullnode operators.\n\n> 51% miner attack ...  (which is not really a very high concern with Bitcoin anyway!)\n\nIt is not a concern if fullnode number is high.  It is a concern if practically everyone is running SPV because the blocksize and/or block rate is too high.  Consider how easily Ethereum makes hardforks, which again are implemented as 51% miner attacks on SPV nodes.  Very few people actually run Ethereum fullnodes, because the blockchain size has grown so much that very few people can even start a new fullnode.\n\n>Also, what does running a full node have to do with resisting government snooping? I don't really see the connection.\n\nVenezuela clamped down on Bitcoin mining because it was consuming large amounts of government-subsidized electricity.\n\nThus if a government decides Bitcoin is BAD because reasons, keeping your energy footprint and bandwidth consumption low makes it easier to hide the existence of a fullnode.  The local power company is usually a government-controlled company reporting directly to the government, the local ISP may or may not be (in many third-world countries, it either is, or one of its upstream providers is).\n\n>>which is why Lightning is good, as it gives an incentive to have a fullnode, effectively paying for the fullnode cost\n>\n>How?!\n\nRouting fees.  It's easy to become a \"hub\" in Lightning: just make a half dozen channels and wait for people to connect to you.  You don't even need to \"lock\" your funds: the funds you have on the channels are readily spendable on any Lightning-accepting merchant.  So a HODLer capable of setting up a small secure system can run a fullnode and a LN node on a high-end single-board (and therefore low-power-consumption, and therefore possible to have a battery) computer, and over time will earn a small sum in routing fees.", 2], ["2017-11-27 14:35:39", "> This study suggests that a 2Mb block leads to 90% reduction in running fullnodes.\n\nNo, no, the study *estimates* that a 2MB block size limit (with all full blocks) would lead to a 40% reduction in full nodes and that an increase to 8MB block sizes would lead to a reduction in 90% full nodes. Important to note that those estimates are based on (i)average system configuration of Steam users in *Aug, 2015* (more than 2 years ago), and (ii) the assumption that all blocks are full.\n\nRegarding (i), Moore's Law would suggest that both those numbers (40% and 90% for 2MB and 8MB blocks respectively) would have come down significantly by now..\n\nAnd regarding (ii), an increase in blocksize limit to 8MB doesn't mean that all blocks are suddenly 8MB. It took Bitcoin 8 years to reach full blocks with the 1 MB limit. Block sizes will only grow linearly and it would be several years before full 8MB blocks are reached. Meanwhile, Moore's Law means that it will keep getting easier to store and transmit the blockchain. \n\n> My understanding is that raw numbers show that in spite of increased adoption we are seeing decreases in number of fullnodes in step with block size.\n\nThe reason behind that is quite obvious. When Bitcoin first came out, SPV wallets weren't a thing. To use it, every Bitcoin user had to run a full node without exception. That was inefficient. Now that SPV wallets are available and are reliable, naturally most people do not feel the need to use them. The network is just reaching a more efficient equilibrium with respect to the number of full nodes.\n\n> A miner-activated hardfork (like what Bcash and 2X attempted) is implemented as a 51% attack on the chain, with SPV nodes following the chain with most proof-of-work regardless of ruleset.\n\nI'm sorry, any miner with non-zero hashpower can fork the chain. I can try to fork the chain tomorrow if I want to. So can you. The thing is, if we do that, no one is going to follow that chain. I won't suddenly become a millionaire by mining a lot of Bitcoins on that chain. The value for the coins come from market demand. Any chain this is maliciously compromised by a 51% hard-fork attack by a miner would immediately lose value while the 'honest' chain keeps its value (unless the market decides otherwise). \n\nThe reason why the Bitcoin Cash fork has value is because the market has decided it has (even though a lot of it may be speculative, like every other coin including BTC). \n\n> That includes rules like how many Bitcoins each block provides as subsidy, as well as the coinbase maturity rule\n\nThe market will follow those changes only if they economic sense make sense...\n\nYou said something about people voting in favour of inflation because it would reduce fees by half. That would only happen if fees are unsustainably high. If you have $0.05 fees per transaction, no one is really going to bother about decreasing fees. If you have $5.00 fees per transaction, people will accept solutions like even coin inflation to solve that problem. \n\n> In any case, block size increases are proportional to fullnode deployment decrease\n\nIf Bitcoin went from 1MB full blocks to 8NB full blocks in one day, then yes. But it doesn't work that way at all. Block sizes will increase gradually from 1MB to 8MB, and hardware and bandwidth will keep getting better as per Moore's Law as blocksize increases.\n\nThe amount of reduction in full nodes that would have happened in 2015 is significantly less than what will happen now in 2017 and it will be even lesser by the time full 8MB blocks are reached.\n\n> Venezuela clamped down on Bitcoin mining because it was consuming large amounts of government-subsidized electricity.\n\n> Thus if a government decides Bitcoin is BAD because reasons, keeping your energy footprint and bandwidth consumption low makes it easier to hide the existence of a fullnode.\n\nRunning a full-node does not consume a lot of electricity, even for 8MB or larger blocksizes. Mining is different. Bandwidth may indeed be a problem with larger blocksizes though. But, again, 8MB block size limit won't see full blocks in several years yet.\n\nHow do you become a hub in LN?", 1], ["2017-11-27 15:29:11", ">How do you become a hub in LN?\n\nRun an LN node, open some channels, wait.", 1]]}, "75": {"created": "2017-11-23 16:13:30", "title": "How to old nodes validate new op-codes?", "num_comments": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "score": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-11-24 02:01:34", "\"new\" OP codes are implemented by soft fork.

Instead, the primary goal (with regards to decentralization) should be \"minimize the CONOP as much as possible\"; secondary goals e.g. \"maximize potential transactional throughput\" or \"minimize the fees necessary for transactions to occur *while ensuring overall system stability and security are not threatened in so doing*\" are fulfilled to the greatest degree possible.\n\nThere is no objective \"perfect magical number\" for these things, but there *are* directions that should be aimed for, in some cases.

There are logical consequences of various scenarios that we can discuss. I think there is some way we can come to an understanding on how decentralized the network is and what level of decentralization is \"enough\".

Non-miner centralization is intrinsically linked to the ease of running a fully validating node. I think we can set some constraints on what we think is easy enough. Like I think pretty much everyone would agree that if a fully validating bitcoin node could be run on 5% of the CPU power, memory, HD space, and network bandwidth of 90% of people's primary computer, that would be easy enough that we don't need to make it easier. It would be nice to also see some upper bound on that, tho for the people who think non-mining full nodes don't even matter, the upper bound is probably absurdly high. But for people who understand they do matter, what would a non-controversial upper bound be? 30% of the resources of the most powerful upper 50th percentile of people's primary computers?\n\nDetermining centralization pressure and effects of protocol design is FAR more quantifiable than what music sounds better.", 3], ["2018-01-18 01:21:12", ">Is there any comparison here that does make sense or is it just not even one worth doing?\n\nGreat question.

If we choose the metric of economic nodes, perhaps if 30% of payments are made to fully validating nodes (and the rest via SPV to one of those 30%), maybe that's fine. How would we show that its fine? One way is that we can see construct worst-case scenarios to see what might go wrong. Worst case scenario is that all the SPV nodes are owned by the same person, and that 70% economic power could be used to change consensus rules (as long as the users of the SPV nodes either don't become aware or don't care). But the other 30% wouldn't be forced to follow that new chain. So maybe this means that if at least 50% of payments are made to fully validating nodes, the network would be significantly safer since a majority would be ensured to retain the dominance of the main chain.

If an SPV node chooses its full-node connection(s) at random, this could be mostly mitigated except in an enormous Sybil attack.... \n\nIn any case, I'm obviously stream of consciousness rambling.

When the minrelayfee was first introduced (months after the blocksize limit was), Satoshi called it \"a first attempt\" at limiting/preventing network spam. The blocksize cap serves many useful functions, but we know for a fact that it wasn't originally put in place as \"a spam protection measure\".\n\nFurthermore, the 1MB cap was **removed completely** a few months ago (when SegWit activated on mainnet), and replaced with a new limit of 4M WU (which is a practical limit of about 3.7MB). That's how [so many blocks are significantly larger than 1MB these days](https://www.smartbit.com.au/blocks?sort=size)... and in fact, it's *very* rare for recent Bitcoin blocks to be *smaller* than 1MB! Go check out the last 100 blocks mined on mainnet; other than one or two \"empty\" blocks, there is only *one* that's smaller than 1MB (about 998kB).\n\nIt's an all-too-common misunderstanding that because SegWit was activated as a soft-fork, it couldn't have increased the maximum blocksize limit. It **did** increase the blocksize limit, in a very clever way (which many do not appreciate at all): it introduced a new [transaction serialization format](https://imgur.com/a/15ipE), which allows the witness bytes (of SegWit transactions) to be identifiable on-the-fly such that they can be stripped or pruned prior to relaying the block to any nodes identifying themselves with version numbers prior to 0.13.1. It didn't actually *move* these witness bytes \"outside of the block\" or add an \"extension block\" reserved for them, or anything like that (which are also common misconceptions); instead, as the visualization I just linked to shows, it keeps the bytes *in the block* (just like always) but marks them with byte-flags, so that they can be pruned on-the-fly as needed. In practice, this is almost never done any more (because very, very few nodes are still running those old client versions), but because of SegWit's clever design, it's still possible (preventing backwards compatibility from being violated *even though* the blocksize limit was objectively increased).\n\nA little-known fact about Bitcoin is that pretty much *any* network/system property can theoretically be changed via a soft-fork, if you're willing to get creative enough with the implementation. There is even terminology for this (e.g. \"evil soft forks\" for soft forks that would undermine things like the 21M coin cap limit). Fascinating stuff, and probably something we need to be wary about, moving forward!\n\n>Networks should never operate all the time at maximum capacity unless there are no other options available.\n\nThis is not actually a true statement, either. With truly-decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin's (at least without some updates made with regards to transaction fee handling), the only known way for the inflation subsidy to safely dwindle to negligible levels (as it is programmed to do over the next decade or so) is if there is an appreciable (and persistent) transaction backlog of *fee-paying* transactions. In other words, if the network were operating at *less* than maximum capacity for extended lengths of time, we would be in huge trouble, and that would be serious cause for alarm!\n\nThe nuances of Bitcoin are unfortunately highly esoteric right now. Almost every statement you've made in your comment here is demonstrably untrue, but the perspective you're voicing is more commonly heard than the corrective responses to it!

Such attacks however costs the miners about $250,000 per block as other miners and exchanges would reject such blocks, so are not very relevant for ordinary end users. From the persepective of an attacker, a valid block attack is cheaper, more effective and less risky than an invalid block attack.\n\nInvalid blocks are any blocks that don't follow the protocol rules. A BCH block looks invalid to a BTC node, and vice versa. If these blocks are already being produced, and there is a market for them (ala BCH), then there is no additional cost for miners.

With huge blocks and therefore cheap and available blockspace, now the blockchain doesn't only serve as a financial ledger, but people can use it as perpetual backup storage, and upload all of their bittorrent movies for negligible fee (or free). Now every node in the network is also being used as a decentralized backup solution. With these use-cases and others, the blockchain could grow much faster than you are thinking.\n\n2. Fees. If you increase the block size today, then we have no pressure to get included in a block, so capacity is wide open. What happens as 2nd layer solutions such as LN come on board, which will relieve block pressure further? Now capacity is open even further. Now there is no competition to get included into blocks.

Bitcoin aims to make nodes available to anyone who wants to run one.\n\n>I realized that the initial download would be ca. 120GB.\n\nYes, that is quite large.

So the blockchain will only be used for larger transactions. The vast majority of transactions will be off-chain, taking pressure off the blockchain to increase exponentially.\n\nThose who advocate for block size only scaling believe that hardware, bandwidth, and storage will increase in efficiency and decrease in cost to keep the economics of running a full node acceptable as the block size increases. That may be the case, but for mass adoption you'd need blocks measures in gigabytes (or 10s of GBs), and the associated storage and processing - even if it's affordable, it seems like a massively inefficient waste to me.\n\nThere are also innovations that help keep transaction sizes smaller (therefore more transactions can fit on each block, therefore the block size doesn't have to increase as much). Segwit is already implemented, and Schnoor signatures promises to improve transaction efficiency further.\n\n>Won't it be far too big in the forseeable future for \"normal\" people to run a full node? \n\nThere are varied opinions on this. \n\nSome people don't think it's important that \"normals\" are able to run nodes.\n\nSome think that the hardware/bandwidth availability and price will keep up with the increased needs. \n\nSome people think that it's best to keep the blockchain as lean as possible to ensure that as many people as possible have the choice to run a node, and to ensure that everyone's coffee and bread purchases aren't being stored forever on thousands of hard drives around the world for no good reason.\n\nHere's some quick figures from a video that discussed how much scaling would be required to enable everyone in the world to make 2 bitcoin transactions per day. You could have either:\n\n* 24GB blocks per 10 minutes\n* 133MB blocks per 10 minutes plus lightning network.\n\nBoth would provide roughly the required transactions.

For example, a network of 3 nodes with no more power over the other is \"decentralized\" from a topography standpoint, but not what most of us want. On the other hand, if we dial back the block sizes small enough, it is feasible to hook a dial up modem to a smart tv, and with a soldering iron it is feasible I could turn my dial up smart tv into a full node. Not idealistic either. The answer is somewhere in the middle. \n\nBlock size directly affects the size of the blockchain, but more importantly, the resources to run a node. Storage capacity is actually the least concern of them all. Nodes are very RAM heavy, blocks need to be fully validated coming in using CPU power to check the signatures, and the blocks need to be downloaded and uploaded in a timely manner so that all nodes can update within the block time making bandwidth the problem. \n\nWhile the full blockchain will continue to grow, storage is by and large very cheap compared to these other aspects. A 2TB hard drive costs under $100 now. Not to mention, once a block is validated, it only exists as a component to the mathematical proof of the order of blocks. Effectively, it is worthless once validated. The UTXO set can be (and is on most clients) stored in its own database.\n\nThere's also methods to reduce the chain past certain checkpoints. If I know that up to a certain point, all the blocks below won't change, I can effectively prune the chain from that point. It is possible that you can simply self validate up to a point, and then delete blocks before that point. As long as a single copy of the chain exists somewhere in the world, it can be validated and duplicated. It is feasible that local libraries will keep the historic full chain, and you may simply run a pruned chain. Or you can keep the full chain if you don't trust the library. The entire point is you have the freedoms. I guarantee some uber nerds out there have the blockchain backed up to DVDs.

There is already capital gains tax, but there could also be an extra tax on any bitcoin payments.  Businesses already have to report their numbers, so it's not like the information could trivially be buried.  It's fine if you just want to use bitcoins to buy one person's worth of drugs, but as soon as you transact with a large public business, the government will know about it.  They don't even need KYC policies to charge a Bitcoin-specific sales tax.\n\nYou could imagine tax-free but otherwise legitimate businesses operating on the dark web, but I doubt they would be more than a niche.  Concealing your business from the government while still advertising it to potential customers, sourcing supplies, etc. seems like it would be a lot harder than just paying tax.  Not to mention the customers have no recourse if they get scammed.

If this seems odd, imagine the following law: every time you get caught evading taxes, we roll a d20.  If it's a 20, you go to jail.  Otherwise, you just get very scared and pay your taxes from now on.  The government would clearly profit from this law even if sending one person to jail costs 10 times as much as taxing one person pays.\n\nAlso, in the worst case the government could just execute tax evaders (or 1 in 20 tax evaders for that matter).\n\nThere are other possible models.  For example, Milton Friedman believed in a negative income tax.  One interesting effect of this is that it provides an economic incentive for everyone to earn money legally, and to report their earnings to the government.  It also means the government would not have to waste large amounts of time and energy going after every citizen who does not pay income tax, and can instead focus on bigger tax offenders.\n\nIn a perfect world, all crime* could be discouraged by simply making it so unprofitable that the government never has to use force against criminals.

As adoption saturates, bitcoin will become more stable than national currencies because of it's algorithmic and very predictable monetary policy.\n\nFree markets in general have positive feedback mechanisms.  This leads to some amount of instability, regardless of supply.  If you can point to a negative feedback mechanism in Bitcoin that makes it different, it would make the claim of superior stability more credible.  Consider that Bitcoin is pretty much engineered specifically to exploit positive feedback and create a speculative bubble so that it gets adopted by many people.  Fiat on the other hand had no viable competition when it was introduced, and is engineered specifically to be non-volatile, based on decades of economic research.  The dollar has been quite [predictable](http://blog.milesfranklin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/purchasing-power-of-dollar.jpg), especially for the past 30-40 years.  By comparison, [this](http://www.cashgoldexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/gold-price-graph.png) is gold.\n\nOf course, Bitcoin is not gold.  Since it is (somewhat) usable as a modern, portable currency, it is maybe more analogous to gold-backed dollars.  I agree that Bitcoin will become much more stable than both its past self and gold if it starts getting used a) by more people and b) as a currency, rather than hoarded by speculators.  But I am not sure how you can justify more stable than fiat.  [Instability](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/gold-standard) is part of the price of freedom from stabilizing entities.\n\nAlso, this is mostly besides the point, but I don't think any stable, used currency can really have a completely fixed supply.  Financial institutions can print and destroy Bitcoin IOUs if it interests them.  We even have futures contracts now.  Long-term increases in the supply of circulating currency could not easily occur without corresponding decreases in solvency, but temporary manipulations of the supply could certainly be done.  Such manipulations would presumably generally serve the private manipulator's financial interests, rather than a central bank's goal of ~~war~~ steady economic growth.  \n\n> It's also a common misconception that inflation incentivizes lending or investment or spending.

These two forces balance to 0. Inflation is irrelevant as a motivator.\n\nThere are some differences, including both highly significant psychological factors, and the case where the loan defaults.  Since we like game theory and rational actors, even if you ignore the psychological factors, inflation partially balances the risk of default.  This changes the _shape_ of the risk-reward relation of deciding to invest vs. hoarding currency, so I don't think you can just take the EV, absorb it into the interest rate, and call it completely equivalent.  I gave an example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinDiscussion/comments/7db7ki/bitchingprofiteeringhodling_has_killed_bitcoin/dpx7f10/).  It strikes me as simultaneously both good engineering and annoying to sound-money idealism.\n\n> This is a similar misconception to the idea that if people could live without working all the time, they would simply stop working. People don't need this kind of paternalistic spur in the ass to want to improve their earnings.\n\nMany people inherently value money and the social status it provides, but many people also value money only because it means not having to work.  I've definitely known people who would retire and watch TV all day if they could.  I think there is a lot of variation in the population, and it is hard to generalize.  \n\nIt's also worth noting that the technology of escapism continues to improve.  I suspect UBI will be beneficial by the time the world is technologically ready for it, i.e. robots being cost-effective at the majority of unskilled labor and unpleasant jobs.

Free markets temper themselves with forces in both directions. Bitcoin is no different, except that it literally has absolutely no supply uncertainty (unlike fiat currencies or most anything actually). \n\n> Fiat on the other hand ... is engineered specifically to be non-volatile, based on decades of economic research.\n\nCould you elaborate on that? The engineering of fiat currency doesn't seem very comparable to the engineering of bitcoin. Where bitcoin was designed basically by one person with an exact technical description (in the form of code), fiat currency was basically the result of political expediency. These are processes that are far from the same level of quality of specificity.\n\n> The dollar has been quite predictable\n\nThe monetary policies of the FED have not been very predictable. You can use hindsight to pretend things were predictable, but the truth is that people had no idea how much the dollar was going to inflate - just confidence it wouldn't be \"too much\" because they trusted the US government and the FED. \n\nThe graph you showed me doesn't look like it was very predictable between 1918 and 1950. And since that graph isn't logarithmic, you can't see any of the fluctuations for the second half of the graph's period. Regardless, Bitcoin should be much more predictable than this. \n\n> I am not sure how you can justify more stable than fiat. Instability is part of the price of freedom from stabilizing entities.\n\nI don't think fiat currency is in any way inherently stable. I wouldn't call something like the FED a \"stabilizing entity\". Multiple countries in the world regularly go into literal chaos every decade because of monetary instability. Its really a tough sell to say that these fiat institutions are \"stabilizing\". Instability comes from uncertainty. Bitcoin has the most certain monetary policy of any priceable item in the history of the world. \n\n> temporary manipulations of the supply could certainly be done\n\nPerhaps.

But I see what you're saying that it changes the shape. But this shape change, in my opinion, is entirely a negative effect on both parties. Both the lender and borrower of that inflating asset is put in the position of losing money while they hold it.

But with markets human behavior often seems to follow a herd mentality that leads to short term volatility.  Does Bitcoin have any unique negative feedback mechanism compared to other markets that prevents this volatility?  I don't think having a very precise supply counts, nor is it completely perfect in that regard: for example, large numbers of coins can be lost more easily than mountains of gold, without anyone knowing what the true circulating supply is.  And while gold's emission is not precisely defined like Bitcoin's is, I would guess that the vast majority of gold's volatility has nothing to do with variations in gold-mining.  I have no source on this one, so correct me if I'm wrong.  Stocks are another example.  The supply is clearly defined, but this is not enough to prevent volatility.\n\n> Stability of the dollar\n\nIt was not until 1971 that the US dollar became fully [imaginary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar#Value).  Central planning has become more sophisticated since then, and economic knowledge continues to improve.  Whether central planning is good or not is a different question than whether or not it makes fiat more stable.  It is not exactly a highly disputed idea in the modern economic literature that the dollar is quite stable in part due to central banking.\n\nIt is like how all the shitcoins legitimately do have magic properties such as \"high volume, instant transactions, no fees, low computational burden on fullnodes\" or \"varies in price from $0.99-$1.01\".  Centralization makes certain problems easier to solve.\n\n> Countries that are doing it wrong\n\nYes, some governments screw up more often than others.  I don't doubt that Bitcoin can have better stability than fiat in those countries, and that is one of the things that is cool about Bitcoin.\n\n> Perhaps. I'm not sure if insolvent methods of manipulation would really hold people's attention when the alternative is holding wealth in a guaranteed non-inflating asset like bitcoin.\n\nMany people already keep their bitcoins on questionable exchanges that get constantly \"hacked\".  Many people are just trying to make a quick buck, and don't directly care about Bitcoin's unique properties. So presumably they would happily hold imaginary bitcoins.  And if you hold real bitcoins, the creation and destruction of imaginary bitcoins would affect the price of your bitcoins too.\n\n> Well, the interest rate has to include the price of that risk right?\n\nUnlike other parameters, the amount of money lost in case of default only matters to the lender and not the borrower.  So decreasing the difference in potential losses between hodling and lending should make it easier for them to agree on a mutually beneficial interest rate.  (This comes at the cost of reducing some sort of economic freedom and forcing the hand of hodlers a little bit, so I'm sure there are philosophical arguments against it.)\n\n> But this shape change, in my opinion, is entirely a negative effect on both parties. Both the lender and borrower of that inflating asset is put in the position of losing money while they hold it. I mean, its kind of like saying that being guaranteed to lose $5 and taking a 50% risk of losing $1 more is better than a 50% risk of losing $6. Its not.\n\nNaturally it's negative to both parties, whether or not they agree on a loan, as the printing of money is essentially a tax.  If there was no printing of money, other taxes would replace it.  So if you start with the assumption that the government is going to collect taxes / everyone loses money, then the question is which way of doing it provides beneficial economic incentives.  In this case, when both hodling and lending involve loss outcomes, people (who are generally [risk-averse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis) compared to directly measuring EV) should be a bit more likely to accept the risk of lending.\n\n> They might say they'd do that, but they wouldn't.

", 1], ["2017-12-14 07:14:38", "> Does Bitcoin have any unique negative feedback mechanism compared to other markets that prevents this volatility?\n\nWell, yes it does. Bitcoin lacks the *uncertainty* that fiat currencies have in their monetary policies. For example, look how much people care about what the FED's going to change the interest rate to today. People are literally halting most of their activity waiting for it. That's uncertainty you don't have with bitcoin. That uncertainty is a catalyst for the herd behavior you're talking about. Less uncertainty, less volatility.\n\n> I don't think having a very precise supply counts, nor is it completely perfect in that regard\n\nIt shouldn't have to be perfect to \"count\". Its just gotta be an improvement, right?\n\n> without anyone knowing what the true circulating supply is\n\n99.999% of people use market mechanisms to determine prices. No one is analyzing M3 money supply to figure out how to price candy bars, or even cars. It wouldn't seems that this would be any different with or without bitcoin.\n\n> gold's volatility has nothing to do with variations in gold-mining\n\nI doubt it has \"nothing\" to do with it, but I'd agree its probably not a whole lot. You make a reasonable point about gold. Its possible tho that something that's a good medium of exchange leads to most people in the world having significant amounts of it, and that when this happens, volatility decreases.\n\n> Stocks are another example. The supply is clearly defined, but this is not enough to prevent volatility.\n\nWhile a company may have a set amount of stock, the value stock is almost always very disconnected from the value of the company it originates from. Stock holders don't have rights to the company's assets or profits in most cases. Stocks are kind of ponziesque because of this. Their volatility is a result of that disconnection. \n\n> It is not exactly a highly disputed idea in the modern economic literature that the dollar is quite stable in part due to central banking.\n\nI don't think that's true. \"Common knowledge\" is different from state of the art theories. Here's just one example that disputes that central banking is a stabilizing factor: http://www.nber.org/papers/w4532 - there are more. \n\nWhether or not that's actually true, I don't believe central banking stabilizes fiat currency. Quite the opposite in fact. Central planning (like any government policy changes) introduces uncertainty - the cause of volatility. You can't have volatility without uncertainty. The *only* cause of volatility is uncertainty. Anything that increases uncertainty increases volatility.\n\n> Centralization makes certain problems easier to solve.\n\nTrue, but volatility isn't usually one of them. To solve volatility via centralization you have to be *verrrrry* good at making people trust you to be very predictable. That necessary trust is kind of an enemy of certainty. Trustless is less uncertain since you remove one way that could go wrong.\n\n> Many people are just trying to make a quick buck, and don't directly care about Bitcoin's unique properties. So presumably they would happily hold imaginary bitcoins.\n\nSure now. But what about when bitcoin saturates? It's value should plateau and then it wouldn't be an investment vehicle as much as a safe place for savings. Even the least financially knowledgeable people know that putting your life savings in experimental insolvent financial instruments isn't a good idea. \n\n> if you hold real bitcoins, the creation and destruction of imaginary bitcoins would affect the price of your bitcoins too.\n\nIs this really true? Is there a similar instrument you could point to that significantly affected the price of the asset it was related to? \n\n> the amount of money lost in case of default only matters to the lender and not the borrower\n\nThis only true *after* the contract has been made. Before the contract has been made, the amount lost in case of default affects the borrower via the interest rate. So I don't agree that lowering that amount should make it any \"easier\" to come to an agreement. I'm not actually very clear what you mean by \"easier\" there. \n\n> when both hodling and lending involve loss outcomes... people..  should be a bit more likely to accept the risk of lending.\n\nAt a psychological level, sure people might illogically treat preventing losses different from encouraging gains. But who are we trying to help here? The economy? The economy as a whole doesn't lose out when someone decides to put their money under their mattress rather than invest it. What happens in that case is that the purchasing power of money goes up by the exact same percentage as the percentage of \"hoarded\" money, and so the exact same value is invested either way. Are you trying to help the individual? Surely increasing the rate of their losses isn't going to contribute positively to that individual's outcomes. So the idea that inflation helps anybody other than the people giving themselves newly printed money seems pretty far fetched to me.\n\n> What if an activity that does not generate income provides a greater sense of purpose to a person than the available activities that do?\n\nWell this just depends on how you see human nature. I think most people want to be recognized by others and/or help others. Most people also want to do things that help themselves. The interesting thing about our universe is that creating something that helps one person is very likely to help many people. I think if left to their own free devices, each person would find some way to help themselves, and use that method to help other people. Some people may lock themselves in a basement and create art no one will understand or see for the rest of their life, but I don't think a high percentage of people would be like that. Most people want to do something others will recognize.

However, markets have many sources of entropy (policy uncertainty, natural disasters, countries go to war, Gangnam Style goes viral, etc.) and pretty much every other messy real-world system seems to perform better with some engineered negative feedback mechanism than without.  Poorly designed feedback mechanisms lead to new issues, but the idea that the free market is so magical in nature that exactly zero negative feedback, other than natural supply and demand, is enough to reach optimal stability seems questionable to me.  Not in the sense that I can tell you for sure it is wrong, because I'm not the one running the simulations, but in the sense that what are the odds?\n\nOut of curiosity, suppose you could remove politicians from the equation, and program a computer that tries to set optimal economic policy based on market conditions, and anyone could view the source code and all the input data.

Surely if all imaginary dollars disappeared, the real dollars would buy more.\n\n> interest rates\n\nSomewhat more rigorous example:\n\nAlice wants a loan for her business, but she is only willing to pay 5% interest, inflation-adjusted.  She doesn't care about the non-adjusted interest rate because she is using the money to produce things that the market assigns a real value to, and she just needs to make a profit.  Bob wants to lend to Alice.  His utility function is logarithmic, so he uses the [Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) to determine how much he is willing to lend to Alice.  This is *not* due to Bob's psychological limitations; even the Kelly criterion produces volatile outcomes by human standards.\n\nCase 1:\n\nInflation is 0%.  Call Bob's bankroll `X`.  Bob therefore decides to lend up to `X * (1.05p - 1) / .05`, where `p` is the chance of the loan being repaid.\n\nCase 2:\n\nInflation is 5%.  Alice pays 10.25% in currency, or 5% adjusted for inflation.  For whatever input `Y`, Bob's inflation-adjusted output (i.e. `exp(utility)`) will be:\n\n* `Y/1.05` if he buries it in the desert\n* `1.05*Y` if Alice pays him back\n* `0` if Alice defaults\n\nBob therefore decides to lend up to `X/1.05 * (1.1025p - 1) / .1025` in inflation-adjusted future money, or `X * (1.1025p - 1) / .1025` in present money.\n\nFor `p = 1`, Bob is happy to lend as much as Alice needs, but for `p` less than 1, the two cases are different, and for `p` less than .952, Bob will only lend inflationary currency.  This is despite the loan having the same utility to Alice in each case.\n\n> The economy as a whole doesn't lose out when someone decides to put their money under their mattress rather than invest it.

Consider theft. \n\n> It is a zero sum game only if loans created this way are wasted.\n\nIncorrect. A loan of $1000 isn't the same if someone floods the market with trillions of dollars. Because of this phenomenon, if you invest your $1000, it only helps the economy if your investment is better than average (creates just as much benefit per dollar as the average investment by this measure). If it is exactly average, your $1000 will devalue all the other investments in total by exactly the same amount you're investing: $1000. Therefore by investing more money, you're not actually causing *more* total economic investment, you're just reallocating that total economic investment.

One of his big current projects is the FIBRE relay network to reduce latency with block propagation.\n- Eric Lombrozo - has his own company, Ciphrex, but also a core contributor.  One of the more outspoken ones, you're more likely to see him in interviews or speaking on panels, etc.\n- John Newbery - recent addition to the core devs.  Was trained at and works for Chaincode labs.  As of their last release, he was the most prolific adder of code on Bitcoin Core\n- Gregory Maxwell - one of the earliest coders and cofounders of Blockstream, has a huge depth of knowledge, most recently announced progress on Confidential Transactions.  Compared to most devs, posts a lot on reddit.  Controversial figure.\n- Luke Dashjr - Similar bio to Maxwell (been around a while, posts a lot, controversial), but nowadays is only a contract worker for Blockstream.  Built knots, an alternative Bitcoin client.\n- Pieter Wuille - quieter personality, but has made massive contributions - most notably was the main guy behind the Segregated Witness update\n- Wladimir van der Laan - lead maintainer of the Bitcoin Core client, but keeps a very low profile otherwise\n- Mark Friedenbach - Another Blockstream Employee, has recently submitted some pretty important proposals for the much anticipated MAST update.\n\nOther Software Development (Building bitcoin-centered businesses or non-protocol software):\n\n- Jameson Lopp - engineer at bitgo, very outspoken and tweets a lot, not afraid to get political\n- Charlie Shrem - been around a long time - built one of the earliest exchanges in new york back in 2011, but ran into legal troubles did prison time for it.  Happily, he's out now and back at it. \n- Erik Voorhees - another business builder from back in the day, including SatoshiDice and ShapeShift\n- Adam Back - a cypherpunk from the pre-Bitcoin era.  His work was actually quoted in the Bitcoin whitepaper.  CEO of Blockstream.\n- Nicolas Dorier - has worked on a variety of software projects, usually just on the peripheral of the protocol, such as NBitcoin (a library to make it easier for coders to build on Bitcoin) and more recently an opensource implementation of Bitpay\n- Eric Voskuil - built an alternative client called libbitcoin.  On the github, he's also written a great series of pieces on understanding certain fundamental concepts of bitcoin.  I've been posting them here one by one.\n- Andrew Poelstra - mathematician, also with Blockstream, currently lead developer for Grin, the first implementation mimblewimble (a seriously cool altcoin).\n\nSocial Media:\n\n- Andreas Antonopoulos - If you're a newcomer, I would just recommend binge-watching this guy on youtube.  He is absolutely fantastic at giving a foundational understanding of bitcoin for newbies\n- Chris Derose - became most well known for his podcast called \"Bitcoin Uncensored\".  I don't think anyone else has done as much work as he has in exposing scammy altcoins.  Still heavily active on youtube, worth looking into.\n- Charlie Lee - created litecoin (the very first altcoin), worked for coinbase, and very prolific tweeter, brother of Bobby Lee\n- Samson Mao - got a name from twitter, likes his memes, and goes for the political stuff.  He earned himself a lot of hate from big blockers, but also a job at Blockstream as Strategy Officer.\n\nBitcoin mining:\n\n- Jihan Wu - CEO of Bitmain, which controls several of the networks largest mining pools, and manufactures most of the ASICs used today.  Instrumental in the creation of Bitcoin Cash, which (among other things, earned him a \"controversial\" mention here)\n- Bobby Lee - CEO of BTCC, influential company in China, includes mining operations and an exchange, brother of Charlie Lee\n- James Hilliard - mostly a hardware guy involved with the mining industry, but got a name for himself by coding in a patch for Segwit2x that saved the network from a network split during the deployment of segwit back in July/August\n- Slush - I'm pretty sure this guy has a real and non-secret name, but he's better known by Slush, which is the mining pool he runs.

Also founded Trezor, one of two most prominent hardware wallets (the other one is Ledger)\n\nControls or Manages Important Sites or Forums:\n\n- Cobra - owner of bitcoin.org, he tweets a decent bit, but overall keeps a low profile\n- theymos - owner of bitcointalk.org and head mod of r/Bitcoin, has tried to keep a low profile, but earned a controversial status due to moderation policies on the two fora\n- Bashco - appears to carry out most of the moderation on bitcointalk and r/Bitcoin\n- Roger Ver - early investor and evangelist, owner of bitcoin.com and head mod of r/btc, also became rather controversial in recent years due to his strong position on big blocks\n\nI'm sure there are a TON of guys that I will kick myself for not mentioning.

You acknowledge that core is not a single entity, but then you say without that it's just a distraction.  It is then implied that the 3 members of core present at the meeting had some sort of authority to force the other members of team to do something.  And even if they did, core has no authority to force a change without the network's consensus.  I think these are very important points that shouldn't be glossed over.\n\n- I disagree with the suggestion that core can \"blockade\" changes.  Core doesn't have the power to force or prevent any change (though they do have influence).\n\n------------------\n\nI think these need to be considered:\n\n- If B2X succeeds, it will mean that a group of companies can unilaterally force changes upon a network regardless of consensus.  This opens a door to outside intervention.  It would mean that a government (or two governments, say China and USA), could look at this and say, \"Ok, so we just need to force these companies to make X change, and the network will accept it.\"  As far as I can tell, this undermines the key value proposition of Bitcoin.\n\n- If the main goal of segwit2x is to keep the community together, shouldn't it be abandoned considering the widespread opposition?  At this point it is virtually guaranteed to cause a split.  If any of the signatories are genuinely motivated by keeping the community together, wouldn't it make the most sense for them to halt it, ASAP?\n\n- Many companies built businesses on the premise that fees will be cheap and confirmations fast.  But just because they assumed this, it doesn't mean that the rest of the community owes it to them.  It is not our fault that they made problematic assumptions about how the community would develop.  At this point, there is a community that is dedicated to such a goal - BCH.  If they really believe in lower fees, then I think they really should switch to BCH, instead of trying to force this value upon everyone in BTC.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nThanks again for taking the time to outline your position, /u/justsomebadadvice .", 5], ["2017-10-05 15:52:43", "My understanding is that the major issue anyone had with 2x was the complete lack of replay protection, and nothing else. \n\nIt's odd that it is not mentioned at all in that otherwise very logical and well written response/comment.

(I can't reply there, they shadowbanned me months ago and then banned me).\n\nCore merging 2x would be the best of all possible outcomes.  The only downside to Core merging 2x is that a minority of users would feel Core had \"given in\" and some of Core would feel the same way.  Some of them might quit, like Maxwell and Luke.  I personally would probably not jump in and contribute to Bitcoin development unless a big change in leadership occurred, and I know I'm not the only one.  Which I'm sure would be fine with Core after the deep wounds this civil war has left.\n\nI'm also not sure that Core's general philosophy and approach to the coin would adapt as it needs to as the coin grows, we might end up in a similar spot in 3 years.\n\nBut, without a doubt, if Core merged 2x, it would keep the vast majority of the community together.  The extreme minority that claim they would not support 2x if such a thing happened would vanish within a week.  The censorship on /r/Bitcoin would let up massively and become focused on Bitcoin Cash versus BTC and Ethereum vs BTC, as it should be.  Bitcoin Cash's price would probably drop even lower.\n\nOf course, that too depends on how Core approached such a thing.  I don't trust Core anymore, and neither do the miners or Businesses.  They will not accept vague promises or a lack of action.  1 year out is too far in my mind; segwit blocks @ 100% adoption will be full by April of next year extrapolating from our previous growth.  And segwit adoption is not happening fast enough to deal with the mempool spikes we are seeing multiple days a week *now*.  But if it kept the community together?  I dunno, it would depend on how it was approached.\n\nReading through that thread though, everyone I could find who is a contributor of core is rejecting the compromise proposal, or at least not supporting it(nullc).

Maybe you're referring to a different issue (I'm talking about the UASF compatible use of BIP8 to activate segwit before August 1st).\n\nHilliard is a UASF supporter who does not support 2x.  He did put in the time to propose and code BIP91 on 2x, but the benefactor of that work was UASF, not 2x.  In my mind it saved UASF from becoming am abject failure, but even without that point, 2x did not need UASF to succeed.  If UASF had to compete with another segwit-enabled chain with only 12% of nodes, no economy, few devs, and 0.3% of the hashrate?  It would have stood zero chance.\n\nThe proposals for compatibility were a make-nice gesture.  Afterwards Hilliard insisted repeatedly that the fork couldn't happen, shouldn't happen, and shouldn't be tied to the segwit activation.  All of this is public information.\n\nMy sentience there was referencing nonpublic information.  It seems that if it were not for one company backing the make-nice-and-be compatible approach, 2x would not have done it.  I see this company get shit on every day in /r/bitcoin as they are a major 2x backer.  If they hadn't taken this approach, the current anti fork war would be much different.\n\n> If the main goal of segwit2x is to keep the community together, shouldn't it be abandoned considering the widespread opposition?\n\nNo, because what you're not hearing about is the number of people, companies, miners who will split if 2x fails.  Right now BCH may have split but they did not split the economy.  A split economy is much, much worse than btc versus some crazies who abandoned the economy.\n\n>  It is then implied that the 3 members of core present at the meeting had some sort of authority to force the other members of team to do something\n\nThere were 7 present.  Even just taking the 7 as \"individual contributors\" they absolutely did not fulfill their individual contributions that they signed on to do.  But looking at the larger context, it was abundantly clear that the miners and businesses needed to talk to core and make a deal with core, and they expected to do so- see the publication 10 days earlier.  Yes, those 7 couldn't bind core, I can agree there.  But that doesn't change the fact that none of them even tried to fulfill the agreement or get core to do what the 7 had agreed to.  Excuses about them as individual contributors only go so far, and that doesn't go as far as excusing them from ever even attempting to do what they agreed.  Meanwhile they got what they wanted from the agreement on the immediate crisis; classic died.\n\n> I disagree with the suggestion that core can \"blockade\" changes\n\nThat just doesn't square with the facts man.  Clearly a very large portion of the community has wanted a blocksize increase for a very long time.  Look at the upvotes in the initial censorship threads and announcements in 2015.  Look at the initial support of segwit2mb, and then the initial support of Barry's compromise proposal- inside/r/bitcoin!!!  Look at the massive growth of /r/btc which before August 2015 had less than 100 users; it now has half as many comments and active users as/r/bitcoin.  Look at the polls from bitcoinity showing huge bigblock support, even before bitcoin.com bought them.\n\nNow go look at the annoying 5-shades of green segwit_support wiki page- on the site owned by Theymos, page mostly created by Luke jr.  Ignoring the arbitrary rules they used to determine who counts as a core developer and who doesn't(see history; it mostly seems to depend on whether you support segwit, as recent, approved pull requests to core are \"required\" fort inclusion except when they're not), that page absolutely does not square with the public information I mentioned showing wide community big block support.  At a minimum it shows that the core group is very not representative.  To me looking at how the support of 2x has changed over time it shows that the core group is literally the driver for, not a respondent to, the opposition to 2x.  Many many of the opposition to 2x only do so because core does.  I think ignoring this influence and \"deciding power\" over that group of users is dishonest.  I'll update this post or re reply with links to what I am talking about.\n\n> If B2X succeeds, it will mean that a group of companies can unilaterally force changes upon a network regardless of consensus. \n\nThis is not true. 2x didn't come from companies.  The only thing they are doing is grouping the economy as a whole together and moving it as one unit to the upgrade.  Many of its members wanted much bigger blocks; their compromise was to accept the smallest possible hardfork change.  Many other members did not want to go against core; their compromise was to do so if necessary for the group to move as a single unit.\n\nUsers and developers back this; I am one.  But we're less vocal and less extreme than either the BCH supporters or the die hard small blockers.  And we're less influential than ceos or the censors on /r/bitcoin, so it is easy to forget we exist.  But the indicators are all present in the history.\n\n> Many companies built businesses on the premise that fees will be cheap and confirmations fast.\n\nThis line of thinking leads directly to the bitcoin is gold argument.  The real history of gold undercuts that argument itself, and I suspect that most of the people using that argument don't actually know the history & reasons why gold became popular.

It could split the community, \"successfully\" allowing NYA signers to move forward with their plans with only half of the community - hey, better than nothing.  It could \"successfully\" gain enough momentum that people seeking to protect their wealth have no choice but to concede the battle.  That is not a success for Bitcoin but a sort of success for NYA at the expense of Bitcoin's consensus systems.  There is what in all likelihood is a slim chance that there is overwhelming support for S2X (squint and imagine that node count and developers' objections somehow don't exist), and that would be the only true success scenario.\n\nIf they fail, they have needlessly split the community and at least some of the hashpower for some time (3 coins with intersection mining migration waves) using lightly if at all tested code which was mostly written by core but merged hastily by garzik, caused confusion for new users, forced the entire community to take proactive measures required by a hard fork and an uncertain outcome etc..  If they \"succeed\" in surviving in some form or another, they will have proven that consensus is not required to change Bitcoin.  They will also have self inflicted the fork.  Combining those 2 results in a significantly reduced political risk to governments desiring to force the same.  In will come blacklists and KYC which is not hyperbolic.  There is no reasonable argument or precedent for governments to remain hands off of such a vehicle, especially one that stands to disrupt their control over the money supply.  If you've got one, please present it.\n\nSo this basically presents a likely-lose/lose situation.  The cons far outweigh the pros.  The best course of action therefore is to abandon the current fork attempt and to instead approach it fresh at some later date when more data will be available which will help determine if and when a hard fork is required.  As SegWit adoption increases, if it's not ample, it will become clear to more of the community that it is in fact necessary meaning that a hard fork could happen non-contentiously which is consistent with Bitcoin's ideals of consensus, and does not set dangerous precedents.\n\nThis is a no-brainer.", 1], ["2017-10-06 02:09:23", "> My sentience there was referencing nonpublic information.\n\nOk.

It is bitcoin minus segwit plus big blocks.  If core really was blocking the popular view, wouldn't we expect BCH to have a lot more support?

This seems like a false dichotomy - that one either has to agree that fees stay low and the blocksize continually grows, or one has to think of bitcoin as gold.

But the rest of what I said is verifiable.\n\n> My mistake, I should have typed \"signatories\".\n\n7 people who are strongly associated with(and actively involved with) Core today.  Meaning: Hilliard, Todd, Lau, Luke, Corallo, Fields, Adam Back.  Mow was not only the organizer and a signatory, but also now strongly against 2x.  So 5 if you want to count literally, 7 seeming more appropriate to me, and 8 with Mow.\n\n> Could you give some specifics? It seems I don't know the details as well as you recall them.\n\nSure.  Essentially there are 4 reasons I've ever seen pointed to for Core's doings regarding the HK agreement, plus the claim that they signed \"as individuals.\"  I'll list all 4, addressing each one, and then I'll give my own observations not related to those.\n\n1. ***Luke proposed a blocksize increase, fulfilling the agreement.***  This claim is the easiest to deal with since Luke himself [admitted in the same email thread](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-January/013497.html), that his proposal did not fulfill the agreement.  Luke's proposal decreased the blocksize and then gradually began rising with no limits.  Definitely not what the agreement was about, which specifically calls for a \"hard fork\" \"including .. non-witness data to be around 2 MB.\"\n\n2. ***SpoonNet by Johnson Lau.***  So when researching for this response, I found that I was slightly wrong.  I would agree that Lau did attempt to fulfill the agreement, so I have to give him credit there.  It doesn't fulfill the exact requirements since it isn't in a release of Core, but that isn't something that can be blamed on Lau specifically.  I don't like that the code wasn't tested or pull request ready, and that it never got a BIP number(Luke Jr's responsibility), and that it didn't have a timeline proposed at all, but at least he produced code that seems to fulfill the terms of the agreement.  Despite that, Lau did not support the segwit2mb proposal and has vocally opposed 2x.  Lau has started at least 3 threads that I can find on Spoonnet.  The first(without blocksize specifics) didn't get real support from the others who signed, but did at least get responses.  The two most recent emails (with blocksize specifics) did not get any responses from anyone else at all, par the for course regarding Core and blocksize issues.  And leaving other signatories with zero effort towards fulfilling their portion; No recommendation as specified, no code, no support of the proposal that does fulfill it.\n\n3. **Agreement specified broad consensus which isn't present.**  This claim doesn't hold up well considering that Core made no attempts that I can find to actually measure consensus, and barely any discussion about how to even do that.  Peter Todd talked in vague terms (while actively stating no hardfork) about measuring coin votes, but Core rejected the [Bitcoinocracy votes that went against](https://web.archive.org/web/20161022193028/http://bitcoinocracy.com/arguments/block-size-limit-should-be-increased-to-8-mb-as-soon-as-possible) their desired outcome.  No action was taken towards measuring \"broad consensus\" so that's pretty weak.  And since the majority of the opposition to 2x cites Core as a major reason for their opposition, even using the contentiousness today creates a circular argument that stems from Core's own resistance.\n\n4. **Agreement was voided by miners breaking it**.  This argument is based upon F2Pool's subsequent signaling for Classic a week later.  In some ways that might be stretched to mean that.  But that would mean that \"miners\" is now a group that F2Pool represents all of, but \"Core contributors\" are still individuals unable to represent \"Core.\"  Moreover, F2Pool is a bit of a troll that has literally signaled for every single competing proposal at one time or another; At one point they were segwit's largest signaler, a complete reversal from being \"the miner that voided the HK agreement for all miners.\"  He signed the NYA, then said almost 2 months ago that he wouldn't support 2x, but still today continues to signal /NYA/.\n\n5. Lastly, the argument about \"individuals\" versus representing Core.  If the \"individuals\" (Lau excluded) had attempted to fulfill the terms of their agreement and been stopped by others, and continued to support 2x as a very similar agreement & compromise, this would be convincing.  They did not.  Moreover, the point of the round table was to [arrange a meeting between Core and the miners](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/a-call-for-consensus-d96d5560d8d6) who had shortly before this [been signaling 72%](https://imgur.com/gallery/dkbrjPx) for a [hardfork](https://bravenewcoin.com/news/bitcoin-classic-node-count-breaks-1000/).  The agreement itself required the miners to stop that plan: \"We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems\" which they did.  Less than 30 days afterwards, yet another meeting was called, because [Core was still stonewalling](https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/13/the-great-bitcoin-divide/), but the miners were satisfied with the HK compromise as struck.\n\n> wouldn't it make sense to hold those individuals responsible for their actions, rather than core as a group?\n\nMaybe, except for one thing - Core's most active members have basically spoken with a nearly unified voice on this issue for the entire last two years, ever since Hearn/Gavin/Garzik quit.  Excepting Lau, who barely attended any IRC meetings since January on [the (outdated) sheet I found](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jNPXPj62xv2GZO_1qHIRQenAx_j-nnkTYC5UYTs8EqA/edit#gid=0), it doesn't seem to make any difference whether the person signed the agreement or not.  The only consistent thing among all of the top 10 Core devs(same sort) is that they oppose the blocksize increase under any situations except vague far-future promises, and 8 out of the top 10(same sorting) attendees either worked for Blockstream or Chaincode Labs (founded by Blockstream co-founder Morcos).  The top 15 attendees includes all 5 \"core contributor\" signatures except Lau's, and has 9 out of 15 being core/chaincode.  In my mind, it would almost be like throwing the individuals who went to the HK agreement under the bus; *Somebody had to go,* or else Classic would have activated.\n\n> Your sources are rather tenuous. I'm sure I could point to a great number of polls that support the opposite.\n\nLets examine this in depth, shall we?  Can you point to such polls?  What I have found is that twitter polls and sybilable online polls depend heavily upon the person who starts the poll and where they link it.  Core supporters polls tend to show support for Core; Non-core supporters tend to show an even distribution, but most of the time with a slight edge to bigger blocks.  Those polls tend to have between 500 and 3000 votes, with one poll I saw having 6000 votes; /r/Bitcoin alone appears to have over 15,000 unique usernames active in a single month from what I've been able to find from public datasets.  As above, Bitcoinocracy had 84% of non-sybilable bitcoin signatures in favor of it, by weight, and also had more by number(with small total numbers).  Luke-jr's sybil resistant poll was impossible to promote in /r/btc, and has only 250 responses.

Sorry about length, lol.", 2], ["2017-10-06 08:57:26", "Part 3 / answers to your questions.\n\n> To my knowledge, there have been quite a few offers to do 1:1 swaps of B2X for BTC, but an absence of takers. Do you not think that this indicates a weaker demand for B2X than for BTC?\n\nI'll be honest with you, I don't know.  Here's what I do know, including some anecdotes that I am sure you will not find convincing.\n\n1. In the past when debating with someone who favored small blocks, someone even said to me that if they had anywhere near as many btc as I had, they'd want bigger blocks for growth / price growth too.  This makes me wonder if smallblockers are not, on average, holding many fewer bitcoins than bigblockers.  Gavin, for example, held onto his Bitcoins.  Luke lost his in MtGox.\n2. The Bitcoinocracy.com and vote.bitcoin.com votes I think are telling.  The vast majority of coins voting prefer bigger blocks, and smallblockers / /r/bitcoin overall tend to ignore vote.bitcoin.com as biased, and similarly ignore bitcoinocracy's archive links.\n3. Most of the arguments for bigger blocks are economic.  Economies drive buying and selling demand primarily.\n\nThat said, I will agree that between 55% and 75% of the active, voting users on /r/Bitcoin at minimum are opposed to 2x and many of the voters seem to be hardcore small-blockers.  Unfortunately, what that means in light of your question becomes complicated because of BCC/BCH.  2x supporters by and large tend to be moderates; BCH / BCC lowered the holdings of all extremists bigblockers because they bought BCC/BCH to keep the price from collapsing below $300.\n\nModerates by definition tend to be less likely to take an extreme position; Selling one fork prior to the fork when the situation is very difficult to read is an extreme position and is risky.  It is something that an extremist like Maxwell or Luke would definitely be willing to do, because they plan to quit anyway if 2x is successful.  They can go all in.  Moderates aren't going to go all in.  I'm a big 2x supporter and a dev, but I'm going to hodl the 1x fork myself.  Why?  I'm just not willing to take that kind of risk.  Instead I'll diversify into altcoins to hedge myself against what I see as the inevitable decline of 1x; Something I've never done before.\n\nBitfinex just launched tokens so the markets can begin to speak.  It is too early to tell exactly what it means; the margin spread between buy and sell is over $2000 dollars wide right now.\n\n> What do you think will happen after the fork in November?\n\nI really don't know to tell you the truth.  It is possible that some companies or miners will back out, though the withdrawals so far have not been impressive (never-heard-of-them type names).  It is possible that 2x will be immensely successful.  It is possible that Core will attempt a PoW change altcoin.  It is possible that 2x will fail to entice the markets.  What I do believe though is this:\n\n1. If 2x is successful and PoW doesn't take hold, many members of Core will quit.  This will represent a loss of knowledge and abilities for Bitcoin, and is unfortunate.  The Core supporters who reluctantly hodl 2x afterwards will be resentful of btc1 and the corporations/miners that supported it.  Uninformed users will be angry at btc1 and at /r/Bitcoin and at everyone.  /r/Bitcoin will be a freaking trainwreck.  Ethereum may still overtake Bitcoin.\n2. If 2x fails, most of the businesses will begin supporting and favoring Ethereum and other altcoins within months, giving Ethereum a huge usability boost.  Some will switch 100% to Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Cash's tx volume and price will at least double, maybe more.  Bigblockers like me who reluctantly hodl 1x afterwards, most miners, and most businesses will be resentful of Core, /r/Bitcoin, and smallblockers for the forseeable future.  I expect the average transaction fee to be above $20 per tx within 12 months, and for weekends to stop having any empty mempools period.  I have difficulty imagining a future where Ethereum doesn't become the dominant coin in every metric before Lightning is ready for general use.\n3. If Core's extremists try to push a PoW change, Core itself is going to be split badly.  The moderates in Core may not like 2x, but they do not like a PoW change to avoid 2x.\n\nThere's my take.  I'm sure you won't be convinced, at least not on everything.\n\n/u/caulds989 here and two other comments that are siblings of this one are my response to /u/makriath.  Sorry about the length and delay.  Took a lot of research to write all that.", 2], ["2017-10-06 08:33:12", "Part 2:\n\n> In fact, the only sybil-resistant poll I know of shows a rather weak amount of support for big blocks.\n\nRight.  As I said, I tried to promote that poll in /r/btc to no avail.  The anemic number of responses on it is concerning given that Bitcoin has [about 3 million active users worldwide](http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/05/07/three-million-cryptocurrency-users/).\n\n> But it's not going to do us much good to trade anecdotes.\n\nUnfortunately, other than mining, Core never had any processes to measure support / consensus.  Until segwit2x mining was split and didn't support either with a critical mass.\n\n> I also think it's quite telling that BCH had a rather insignificant chunk of the economy follow it.\n\nBCH intentionally dumped the economy.  The economy had already signed a competing agreement; Even Bitcoin.com, a major BCC supporter, won't 100% back BCC until after segwit2x fails or succeeds.  They forked in an absolute rush without attempting to collect or garner economic support.  Nearly everyone thought that the coin would completely die out, myself included.  The reasons why the economy didn't follow it had little to do with core and much more to do with BCC's crappy choices.  Their anti-segwit argument was hollow, confusing, and conspiratorial.\n\n> If core really was blocking the popular view, wouldn't we expect BCH to have a lot more support?\n\nNo, for the reasons I said\n\n> If everyone wanted a blocksize increase, wouldn't we expect more users there?\n\nUsers follow economic activity, Bitcoin is a network effect.  Businesses drive the largest portion of economic activity.  Even Jihan thought BCC was a horrible idea and trashed it on twitter it until they proved they could stay alive with some value through the dumping.\n\n> It has been on a steady decline relative to BTC, by both price and transaction volume.\n\nBecause that's what happens when a philosophical appeal comes up against market forces.  Market forces are stronger than philosophy when given enough time, every time.\n\n> it doesn't change the fact that they decided to push this throughout without regard for the greater community's wishes.\n\nLinked in part 1 shows that at minimum a simple majority of the community was in favor of it - Until Core spoke out against it, that is.  That's even in censored pro-core forums; the voting would most likely be very different if 2 years of censorship hadn't changed the voting patterns from what I linked in August 2015.\n\n> I, too, want low fees and a network that people can use quickly. I just disagree on the best path to getting there.\n\nThe only way to do that right now is a blocksize increase.  Core's opposition to this goes way, way back.  Todd in 2013 was opposed to [even to precedent of core increasing it](https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk00281.txt).  Wladamir wants fee markets to rise to [**force** people onto layer 2](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/007890.html) solutions.  Corallo [agreed](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/008354.html).  Maxwell said [any hardforks except a POW change](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6h612o/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_core_wont_endorse/diwmgvo/) are unethical.  Luke wants blocksizes to decrease and says [no increase is needed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/dficjhj/) for the near future.  Every one of those names is in the top 15 Core devs by attendance; 4 out of 5 are in the top 8.  Why did Core 0.15.0 not use segwit by default, and 0.14.xx not include code to use segwit by default post-activation?  Because the majority of core developers are fundamentally opposed to the blocksizes being increased.  Luke refuses to use it simply to keep fees higher.  Maxwell said recently if blocks are ever empty then Bitcoin is broken.\n\nThere's lightning.  I don't know if you are referring to that as your \"low fees and usable network\" basis, but lightning has a lot of [problems that will hamper](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/73da32/could_somebody_give_me_the_other_side_of_segwit2x/dnqdkuz/) adoption, and needs [bigger blocks anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/73m4ah/shadowbanned_scroll/dns5j75/?context=1).  If users are forced to choose between high fees and lighting's tradeoffs, they may actually just choose Ethereum or Iota or some other altcoin.  Let me know if you want me to explain how those problems work.  Lightning is also 18 months away from being readily usable by nontechnical people at the soonest.\n\nThe only remaining way I can imagine that you prefer low fees and a highly usable network is if you follow the narrative that our current volume is due to \"spam.\"  This narrative, also spread by core developers, does not hold up to scrutiny.  Bitcoin can only process 8.7 million transactions a month, times 1.7x segwit's current adoption level.  Extrapolating from Bitpay's [public growth numbers](https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-growth-2017/) and their [previously released transaction volume](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitpays-bitcoin-transactions-reach-time-high/) puts them at ~550k transactions a month, not including sweeps and exchange transfers.  Coinbase has another 47k merchants, though I can't get a comparable number to extrapolate that to transaction volume.  I can't find the source, but Shapeshift handles between 2 and 3% of that available cap.  The Copay wallet moved $1.9 billion a month in value; Using blockchain.info's graphs, I got an approximate value-per-transaction of $4230 per tx for the same month, so if you'll allow me assumption that Copay's average would be reflective of Bitcoin's average, that's another 450k transactions a month accounted for.  Just between Bitpay, Copay, and Shapeshift I'm getting 1.25 million transactions accounted for.\n\nThat means that the remaining 7.45 million tx/day capacity is used by every single other business on the planet.  Every exchange, every miner, every pool payout, all 3 million active users, Changelly, all 10 million coinbase accounts, all 16 million Blockchain.info wallets, all circle and genesis trading OTC settlement, everything has to fit in that 7.45 million transactions.  Spam?  Please.  The only evidence of spam is an oddity in a graph that accounted for a (relatively) tiny amount of transactions and ended in January 2017, and two odd spikes in 2015.  I haven't seen any other evidence.  Meanwhile, the smoothed graphs of our transaction growth for the last 4 years absolutely predicted that our current mempool spikes and high fees would happen; Our growth in the past 4 years until 2017 was +120%, +35%, +80%, +81%.  Our increased fees was overdue, and is actually causing [transactions per day to drop](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?daysAverageString=200&timespan=all).  At the same moment that mempools ballooned, [altcoin value shot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DALFglbUMAAEre6.jpg:large) through the roof.  That's just markets right?  Doesn't matter?  Except right as Bitcoin's transaction volume [peaked, Ethereum's transaction volume exploded](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-sma90.html).  Ethereum has processed [more transactions than Bitcoin every day](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth.html#3m) for the last 71 days straight.\n\nSorry for the rant, but these numbers terrify me.  Our transaction growth has grown by 80% per year for 4 years before now; Bitpay has grown **even faster than that** recently, yet transaction volume is **DECLINING?**  Bitcoin isn't special, Bitcoin must compete for users, adoption, merchants, and use-cases.  In Core's mind, as I showed above, if fees are low they are failing.  In Core's mind, adoption is spam.\n\nI'll answer your two questions in a third reply.", 1], ["2017-10-07 11:57:05", "> Well we had more than 15k pending transactions 5 days this week\n\nYou mean when BCH was more profitable than BTC? Yeah, that's because of EDA.\n\nAnyway, you're looking at this from the wrong angle. What we need to see is not if SegWit will solve the scaling issue (it won't), it's if *further* increasing the block size is *safe*. Specifically because a simple hard fork increase would would suddenly increase the max block size.\n\n>18 months?\n\nLightning will be usable to some extent far sooner than 18 months. There's already a simple Lightning testnet wallet on Android. It doesn't need to be fully usable for everyone to take a large number of transactions off chain.\n\nIt's pretty sad that you care more about on-chain scaling than security or decentralization. As if on-chain scaling alone could ever bring Bitcoin to the entire world.\n\nHere's [something](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_is_not_ruled_by_miners) for you to think about.\n\n>###Current centralization\nIf Bitcoin was ruled by miners, then this would currently be quite terrible security-wise. As of 2017, less than 10 individuals command a majority of hashrate. This is probably far more centralized than even most fiat currencies, and completely defeats the main point of Bitcoin, which is to be decentralized money.\n###Efficiency\nIf you are OK with 10 or so individuals controlling the currency, then you can design a much better system than Bitcoin. For example, you can design a system using chaumean e-cash with the following properties:\n\n>* 20 independent entities are designated as signers.\n* As long as a majority of signers are honest, the system remains secure.\n* The system has perfect anonymity. The signers cannot know anything about the flow of money.\n* Transactions are instant, requiring only communication with the signers and a small amount of computation.\n\n>If you want to preserve the mining mechanism, you can create a simple proof-of-work block chain which simply determines the current signers and creates coins. Users of the system would look at the most recent blocks only to determine the public keys and IP addresses of the current signers, and then use the system as previously described.\n\n>This system would be better than Bitcoin in several ways. But the point of Bitcoin is to be decentralized, so Satoshi rejected this idea (which has been well-known for over 20 years) and created Bitcoin instead.", 2], ["2017-10-06 14:01:06", "No worries about length.

The core contributors who went to the roundtable got what they set out to get - Classic died.  The miners and businesses did not - a hardfork scaling Bitcoin with Core's approval.  If 2x fails, they will have gotten everything they wanted - segwit without a blocksize increase - and given nothing up except a year of delay and the opinions of people like me.  Businesses on the other hand have suffered with high fees, and even today get blamed whenever their approach to fees fails to perfectly predict the fee markets (which is impossible for software to do, btw).\n\nIn my mind I want to treat each person individually.  So you'll have to take that as my answer.  But it still seems wrong to me; The miners came there and actually brought committed resources to the table that could accomplish the other side's goal.  The core contributors did not, and I'm inclined to think that was intentional looking at everyone's actions and statements before and after.  The objective of each side was clear before, during, and after.\n\nThere's not really any point in going on with this point, we're not going to agree.  I think what Core did in that event was dishonest.

They even banned everyone who posted there for a time.  Moreover, /r/btc was **nothing** before August 2017.  Literally no users.  After the banning began, only the extremists posted there first.  It quickly became a rather intolerable place for everyone that wasn't an extremist.

I've moderated forums since long before Bitcoin (some quite large), and I know how moderation affects people. \n\nThe massive difference in upvotes then versus the extremely tiny and slow growth of /r/btc are ample evidence that the opinions have changed.  Check [redditmetrics.com and compare bitcoinxt](http://redditmetrics.com/r/bitcoinxt) (graphs aren't working) - It went from 100 subscribers to 10,000 subscribers in 13 days - versus /r/btc which took 5 months to go from 1000 subscribers to 10,000 subscribers, and another 6 months to hit 20,000 subscribers.\n\nSo if they didn't go to /r/btc, where did they go?

When fees are > $1, raise blocksize.  When fees are less than $0.05 for an extended period of time(Hint: Will never happen again), softfork to lower blocksize or have miners turn on limits again.  Anything above $0.05 per transaction will dissuade the unlimited demand use cases like the hyperbolic \"storing data.\"  Anything above $1 puts the ecosystem at risk.

I find that really surprising.\n\nAbs-o-fucking-lutely.  Bitcoin is a pure network effect.  What is a Bitcoin worth?  What people will pay you for it.  How do you use a Bitcoin?  You send it to someone *who wants them*, who only wants them because someone else *will pay them for it*.\n\nEvery single person that is added to the network increases its value.  Speculators buy something because they think it will be worth more in the future, but speculators are fickle and can wreak devastation as easily as euphoria.  Users buy the coins because they need to do something with them or because it is the best option.  They aren't fickle, and a steady stream of them is what builds an economy.  Businesses need those users to make money, but in turn, those businesses build features that make the ecosystem more valuable itself.  I dove into Bitcoin headfirst in 2011.  Do you have any idea how long we waited since 2009 to have a goddamn debit card?  I remember people talking about it in 2013 like a dream.  It also took us **6 years** until we had a robust set of exchanges that weren't constantly in danger of being shut down or collapsing under their own weight.  We didn't even have Satoshidice until 3 years after Bitcoin started, and it took another year to reach its' stride. It took 2 years until we had the silk road and another year before it actually became big.  It took 4 years until we could actually **spend** [our bitcoins on much of anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1a9a07/buy_anything_on_amazon_with_bitcoin_no/) and yes I specifically remember how big of a deal gyft was because there was nothing else to make it usable in most situations.  You literally couldn't do ***anything*** with Bitcoins when I bought them.\n\nHow hard is it for those businesses and services to now support Ethereum?  **Very, Very, Very easy.**  Bitcoin has done all the hard work.  Legal frameworks?  Check.  Governments saying they're not going to send you to jail?  Check.  Software stack?  Check.  Product offerings proven?  Check.  Exchanges?  Check.  Positive news attention?  Check.  Stable price that can be depended on for at least short periods of time?  Check.  ETF submitted to SEC?  Check x3.\n\nAll of those things transfer for Ethereum very, very easily.  If a user tries to transact or use a coin for something and finds that Bitcoin is too expensive, they will go to another coin.  Then, the next time they go to transact, they'll prefer that coin because **they're already on it.**  Businesses will be keenly paying attention to which areas of its business are providing what amounts of revenue.  Users going to Ethereum will make the businesses invest in Ethereum infrastructure first.  Guess what project the bitnodes creator is submitting commits to?  Guess what project [Joseph Poon](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-lightning-buterin-poon-unveil-plasma-scaling-plan/) left Blockstream to work on?  Guess which project I'll be contributing to as a 13 year C++ programmer if 2x fails?\n\nBefore March of this year, Bitcoin didn't have to compete. There was no one on Ethereum to transact with, just like Monero, Dash, ETC, Iota today.  If you wanted to actually gain a real world result in some way, you used Bitcoin.  This year changed everything.  Ethereum is popping up on black markets; For small transactions it is going to be the only reasonable choice. The exchange robustness that took Bitcoin 6 years to build, Ethereum got in 2.  If 2x fails, the businesses that have been attacked and shit on for two years now while suffering with ever rising fees will make BCH and Ethereum support a top priority.  Ethereum already has debit cards; Full Bitpay and Coinbase merchant support will come within 6 months of 2x failing.  Worse, [businesses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/06/07/bitcoin-is-at-an-all-time-high-but-is-it-about-to-self-destruct/#6615e99ccb31) are [actively](https://twitter.com/guerrillamail/status/838001194106642432) leaving [the](https://cointelegraph.com/news/retailers-turn-their-backs-on-booming-bitcoin-trade-magazine) ecosystem [today](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-fees-chasing-businesses-away-dash-litecoin-benefit).\n\nSo you must compare the two currencies side by side.\n\n1. Remember how I said mining decentralization could benefit from faster blocktimes and uncle blocks?  Ethereum's got em.\n2. You know how much this scaling debate sucks ass and how the Bitcoin community is constantly attacking eachother?  It would be really great if there were a forcing function built into the protocol that *FORCED* people make a decision on the issue.  Oh, right, Ethereum's ice age.\n3. I mentioned UTXO commitments as making SPV trustless and (not sure if I mentioned) giving us trustless warp sync?  You guessed it, Ethereum's got it.\n4. Bitcoin mining rewards total to $254 million dollars **a month** currently. Bitcoin's mining saturates and guarantees that almost all of that goes to real world costs.  Bitcoin miners must sell >$100 million dollars a month to cover their costs.  I know, I've been through the wringer even with unbelievably cheap electricity costs, and it sucks.  That sale must be balanced economically or the price of Bitcoin will decline; If Bitcoin doesn't have new speculators or use-cases coming in willing to buy that >$100 million dollars a month, Bitcoin is in deep shit.  Guess what Ethereum's plan includes?  Yeah\\*.\n\nSome more flat real world comparison facts:\n\n1. 72 days straight Ethereum has processed more transactions per day than Bitcoin, and counting\n2. For lower fees\n3. With a substantially faster confirmation time\n4. While having more full nodes\n5. That cost [less money](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/9991/what-is-paritys-warp-sync-and-why-is-it-faster-than-geth-fast) to run per month while supporting the network just as much\n6. With less PoW lost to orphaned blocks\n7. [Without having](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/median_transaction_fee-btc-eth.html#3m) too-low [transaction](https://etherscan.io/chart/pendingtx) fees or empty [mempools](https://etherscan.io/txsPending) that encourage waste.\n8. With [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/) mining [decentralization](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/) due to both GPU distribution and lower pool barriers to entry. (Compare active user count there!)\n9. With a community that isn't engaged in a civil war with itself.\n10. And isn't telling people to go use other things.\n11. With more distributed forums and places for discussion that do not represent a central point of control or failure.\n12. With developers that are friendly, accepting, open to compromise, and innovative.\n13. Without miners being forced, asked, wanting, or maybe even able to make decisions on the protocol itself\n\nThe only things Bitcoin has in its favor is a more recognizable name, the perception that Ethereum isn't supposed to be a currency / payment system, and perceptions that it is not trustless like Bitcoin.\n\nGuess what?  Name recognition gets fixed over time as adoption grows, or even just a big advertising campaign.  Ethereum can do currency stuff *better*, it just happens to do *other stuff too* so that perception can change.  And the trustless part?  Die-hard libertarians and smallblockers will never accept Ethereum.  But the markets, users, businesses... don't care. Ethereum has all of the essential properties that make Bitcoin trustless.  It forked to fix a bug/theft, but so what?  They actually voted across the ecosystem and got consensus.  [No one uses Ethereum classic](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth-etc.html#1y), it has almost no transactions per day and isn't rising, and they don't have any major innovations planned to draw attention or adoption to themselves.  Ethereum's going to hardfork before 2x, with less planning and more added to the ecosystem, and the fork is going to be a thousand times smoother than 2x.\n\nAnd once users and Businesses are happy with Ethereum, they don't come back to Bitcoin.  Why would they?  If Ethereum becomes dominant in every metric, Bitcoin will begin sliding by comparison and it will probably never stop.\n\n\\* I used to think PoS was a terrible idea. I both didn't understand how Ethereum was going to solve the nothing-at-stake problem, particularly the long-range history problem, and I approached it like so many others - Looking for reasons it would fail.  If I had taken the time to read everything they wrote and understand it, I might be retired now. Oh well. This was what changed it for me. [Vlad didn't ignore the problem](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/07/history-casper-chapter-2/).  These two quotes [solved it](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/):\n\n> Vitalik was a bit uncomfortable with this argument at first, trying to hold onto the ability to authenticate from genesis, but eventually was convinced by the necessity of this kind of subjectivity in proof of stake protocols.\n\nWhat does he mean?\n\n> Fortunately, for them, the solution is simple:[..] they need only get a recent block hash from a friend, a blockchain explorer, or simply their software provider, and paste it into their blockchain client as a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d.\n\nWait, what?

Satoshi succeeded where [cypherpunks like Core](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/914829520078860288) had been failing for decades.  Why?  Because Bitcoin is *not perfect.*  It *has* a known flaw.  So what.  No one cares, not even Core or cypherpunks care.  Ethereum is focusing on what **works** to solve problems.  Not hypothetical perfect security.\n\nI used to think that Ethereum wasn't a problem because Bitcoin can easily do everything Ethereum can do.

It's almost equaled Bitcoin on active addresses per day and USD value transferred per day.  It is only going to get worse... within 9 months Bitcoin fees will spike again, assuming enough businesses and use-cases haven't left to prevent that from happening.

Bigger blocks absolutely 100% positively does not centralize mining.  I'll prove it to you if you don't believe me, literally no core supporter has ever countered this point, and I think it was a major contributor to me getting banned from /r/Bitcoin(Can't stop people from being mislead if the counter arguments can't be posted where anyone will read them!!).  Mining devices only process block headers through the stratum protocol.  They are not affected by blocksize in any way shape or form.  \n\nMining **pools** are affected by blocksize increases.  The way everyone looks at this, which is only a portion of the story, is the orphan rate for a mining pool.  As I'm sure you know, this is determined(in part) by how long it takes between when a previous block was available on the network and when they begin mining on it.  That's the centralizing part, right?  Wrong.  A mining pool with 1% of the network hashrate has a monthly revenue of $2.5 million dollars.  Running a full node can be done for [$4 a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6yopwt/run_a_bitcoin_full_node_for_50_a_year/).  Now obviously a $4 fullnode is not going to be sufficient for a 2.5 million dollar operation.  So lets say they decide to spend $1000 a month on a high end service out of a proper datacenter; That's 0.04% of their expenses.  That's not 4%, that's 0.04% - less than one tenth of one percent.  Their super bigblocker competitors spend $5000 a month on an even higher end service.  What's the difference between a $1000 a month node and a $5000 a month node?  $1000 a month will get you a [10gig uplink, 16 core processor, SSD driven computer with 200 gigabytes of ram](https://www.linode.com/pricing), and you can choose a location with a minimal rtt between the network, you, and the miners.  What does $5000 a month get you?  **5 of those.**  Even if the \"big blocker wanting centralization\" DID find a more powerful 64 core server to blow money on, it isn't going to make a damn bit of difference.  It might get them through the validation process 30 milliseconds faster, if that, since the more CPU cores are not going to speed up the bottlenecks at that point.\n\nWhat difference does 30 milliseconds make?  Literally the location the operator chooses and their peering makes a substantially bigger difference than the blocksize could possibly make.  The round trip time for the miners doing stratum(80-150ms) - and their getwork updates to the stratum proxy(~1000 ms) - makes a far, far bigger difference than the blocksize might, and none of those things are affected by blocksize changes.\n\nSo why do we have less than 20 entities worldwide running pools?  Because of the software, and because of psychology.  People gravitate towards a small number of entities that they can read the reviews on and evaluate.  They're not going to pick the 50th most popular because they're going to stop after the top 15 and just pick one.  To make this worse, mining does centralize due to outside factors like low electricity prices and proximity to the manufacturing, but A) that has nothing to do with blocksizes, and B) other than the manufacturing, it is actually not nearly as bad for centralization as people assume.  Mining facility economies of scale are actually not very good, which is why there's thousands of datacenter & hosting companies worldwide, but only two major chip design companies(Intel/AMD vs Nvidia/ATI).\n\nBut that's just part of the story.  Look at all the failed mining pools out there.  BTCGuild?  Government stepped in.  Ozcoin?  Orphan rates were too high back before blocksizes were even 500kb, and payouts too low.  Bitminter? Same as Ozcoin.  I know this because I was there and I've done it.  As it turns out, setting up a successful mining pool is **fucking hard to get right**.  Every lost block is a huge amount of money lost, but if you're only producing 1 block a day, how do you know when things aren't working?  Wait a day?  Even identifying that blocks-to-be aren't happening is very difficult, and then identifying WHY they aren't happening is even harder.  Once you get the software working right the job becomes much, much easier - just have to monitor and do occasional updates.  But clearing that hurdle in the first place is huge.\n\nThe solution to this is software.  That's Core's realm.  Notice that they don't provide anything here, except the much touted \"fibre network.\"  Mining pool software is clunky and hard to come by.  Most of a mining pool's resource costs actually goes into serving the stratum requests because there may be tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of mining devices connecting to it depending on how well configured the end hosting facilities are configured, and how much latency they sacrifice in local stratum server/proxy layers(Again, not affected by blocksize!).  Peering is a pain in the ass to get optimal.  And the only place where something can be done about this is in the software layers.  If Core's priority was really to decentralize mining pools, you know what would help?  Lower the blocktime and add uncle blocks.  Uncle blocks basically remove the orphan problem entirely, and if done right they can simultaneously avoid most of the efficiency losses.  Lowered blocktime would provide immense relief and help for the pools(and mining facilities!) struggling to keep the extremely rare cases of block production regular and monitor-able.  Notice what's not on Core's roadmap or discussion anywhere?  Those things.\n\nThe issues I described above of the performance versus cost for a $1000 fullnode server and a $5000 fullnode server holds for much, much larger blocksizes.  It would have to be over 100mb before those numbers changed, but even then the scaling doesn't actually change the outcomes of the formulas.  Because increased scaling means increased adoption(excepting \"data storage\" use-cases, which aren't a current problem and likely never will be again) huge scales mean huge Bitcoin price; At any scale the cost of a fullnode is and will be a tiny, tiny proportion of a mining pool's cost structure, and an insignificant problem compared to all of the other ones they must solve.  Bigger blocks does not centralize mining in any way.  I have never had a core supporter actually counter this point, and I know what I'm talking about with the costs above because I did it for 3 years.\n\n> and reducing proportion of full nodes...\n\nOk, great.  Maybe you're convinced, I hope so.  But what about the network's full nodes?\n\nWhat purpose do fullnodes serve for the network?  1) They make it so that people can transact on Bitcoin.  2) They provide DDOS protection. 3) They provide sybil attack protection, 4) they provide some level of privacy protection.\n\nThat's all the uses I'm aware of.  1 can be accomplished with both light clients and SPV wallets, and a combination of the two.  With UTXO commitments they can do this trustlessly.  4 can be accomplished with 1 by having the wallets shard out and add in known dummy addresses, making it impossible for a snoopy node to determine what addresses actually belong to the wallet or not.  That leaves us with 2 and 3.\n\nSo here's the question that I cannot get an answer to from Core or any Core supporters.  How many full nodes do we need?  How do we know when the network is in danger?  2 is relatively easy - 2000 fullnodes provides a crapload of DDOS protection, and 5000 is going to be nearly impossible to attack.\n\nFurther, research shows that the number of fullnodes goes **UP** [when transaction volume goes up](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2014/projects2014/cs224w-27-final.pdf), and so does price.  The Core assumption that increased blocksizes will reduce the fullnode count may actually be completely backwards.  More evidence for that?  The number of fullnodes and core nodes has [continually and organically increased over the last 18 months as the blocksizes grew closer and closer to the limit](http://xtnodes.com/#all_nodes)(click view lifetime).  The spike in classic nodes complicates the graph, but you can see the trend in core nodes, especially starting after the XT drama died down in November.  Also note that literally 65% of Bitcoin's [total transaction history](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-total?timespan=2years) came from the time period after November 2015 (91m -> 260m). What's that, you want MORE evidence?  Who processes more transactions per day, Ethereum or Bitcoin?  [Who has more fullnodes](http://flippening.watch)?  Yeah, Ethereum does.\n\nNo one has ever been able to describe to me any other attacks that having more fullnodes protects against.  Sybil attacks?  Great, what's the math on it?  What's the game theory?  How can we measure whether the network is in danger?  Zero answers to those questions.  There is no point in protecting against boogeymen, especially when doing so endangers the growth and adoption of the network, which is what I'll get to in the next reply.\n\nSo yes, I admit that increasing blocksize is likely to have an effect on the proportion of fullnodes.  I just don't think we need most of those nodes and no one can show me otherwise.  And we definitely don't need the sybil \"UASF\" fullnodes that don't even transact and literally only exist so they can bump up a number on a website somewhere with their UA string.  For the forseeable future, blocksize increases will have little to no impact on node distributions, maybe even increasing them.  At huge scales users transacting with small amounts will have to switch to SPV and light clients, so we need to have those ready by then.  But Bitcoin will never be in danger of any attacks so long as fees are > $0.05 per tx.\n", 6], ["2017-10-07 12:05:10", "> There is no reason why it is not safe.\n\nThat's a claim you'll need to prove.\n\n>Fullnode counts do not protect against any actual real attacks\n\nThey protect against the Craig Wright/r/btc fantasy that miners control bitcoin.

They still haven't cleared through the batched backlog of sweep transactions that were started months ago.\n\nSure, this happened, but I think it's a bit of a misleading metric.  Price per byte is much more meaningful, and median fees are much more relevant.  A single massive batch transaction can skew averages rather heavily.\n\nThat being said, I agree that fees are rising, and I agree that they will continue to rise.  Regardless, I think that will become less and less of an issue as lightning and other second layer solutions manage to make more and more efficient use of that blockspace.\n\nMy own predictions were:\n\n>>I think 2x is going to fail, we might see a small migration of users to BCH and ETH, but overall the BTC economy will still be strong.

We'll get gradually larger blocks as segwit adoption continues.\n\n2x did fail, though not exactly in the way I imagined.

Slow-but-steady growth of LN on mainnet, corresponding with slow-but-steady growth in segwit usage/blocksize.  Probably mainly a period of research and testing for MAST/Schnorr/Taproot/Graftroot/Lightning enhancements (like channel factories).\n\nI think BCH will see gradually increasing volume and blocksize, but relative to Bitcoin it will stay pretty much the same as where it is.  I don't think that any newly researched updates will see widespread usage, and the tune will mostly be the same in a few months, where its userbase focuses more on blocksize, comparing themselves with BTC, and spreading adoption, and less on their own technical developments.  I hope we see their 8MB blocks fill up, and I hope we get to see what the response is, but I doubt that'll happen until later on in the year, at the earliest.\n\nI don't think anything remarkable will happen with ETH, and sharding and PoS will still be just as far away as we are today.

Nodecount was way up in August 2015, and again in March 2016.  Why? XT and Classic.  Ethereum's nodecount dropping?  Yeah, it just went through an astronomical price rise.  Hype dies down, nodecount drops a bit.  If the nodecount drops below 50% of Bitcoin's nodecount (eth is 50% of market cap) THEN I will be quite concerned.\n\nAnd yeah, those timescales aren't what I applied for my other graphs, sue me.  It is a little different when every graph is showing the same thing, versus your issue of a single, relatively small nodecount decline that doesn't correlate with other worrying trends.  See below:\n\n> So...what's going on there?\n\nEthereum just went through an absolutely unbelievable price spike, from a baseline of $12 to $~400 in four months.  Hype drives activity and nodecounts higher.  As hype fades, nodecounts drop.  To be honest, I'm more surprised the price of Ethereum hasn't fallen **farther**.  I actually expected it to.  Using BTC as the benchmark, after Bitcoin's 2011, 2013, 2014 price spikes, the crashes took Bitcoin down 84-95% from the peak to trough.  Ethereum is only down 50% from its peak against btc.  It should have fallen much, much farther after the euphoria wore off.  Still could, but it doesn't seem to be happening.\n\n> That's because they're still centralized...the Ethereum Foundation calls all the shots.\n\nUnlike, say, [Theymos](https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/1835) having control over the website, the forums, the reddit, **and the wiki**.\n\nThe exact same arguments apply to blockstream+chaincode+core.  Ethereum is open source, just like Core is open source.  If people don't want to use it, they won't.  Unlike Core, Ethereum is actively encouraging multiple competing clients and development teams.

He walks through a little bit of the math to compare and contrast the \"pure on-chain\" approach with the \"heavily incorporating LN\" approach, and does a decent job, in my opinion.\n\nHe also examines the question of payment-routing, and how hubs may or may not factor into the picture as the network evolves.

I think that Lightning Network won't be quite so appropriate for \"the entire range of payments\", though; I expect that high-value payments will probably not need payment channels in most cases, and that shoehorning them through Lightning Network doesn't make much economic sense (or at least, not nearly as much as smaller payments do).\n\nMost of the content in here is stuff that's been said elsewhere (and might not be new information for many of us here), but I'm a big fan of thoughtful compilations like this (the [Speculative Bitcoin Adoption/Price Theory](https://medium.com/@mcasey0827/speculative-bitcoin-adoption-price-theory-2eed48ecf7da) article is another great example that I find myself referencing often, because it represents a well-bundled-up collection of thoughts that many of us have gone through).\n\nP.S.

I recently spent some time thinking about routing, and came to the conclusion that address based routing is the way to go. Without address-based routing, you likely end up triggering millions or even  hundreds of millions of messages per LN route found. If each of 7 billion nodes had 3 channels, while you could easily store network typology for 1.5 million nodes in 25mb giving you a cache of 13 hops away, destinations would likely near 1900 hops away and so you'd also have to query almost your entire cache of 1.5 million nodes for a route each time you want to make a payment OR each time someone wants to make a payment through you. This doesn't seem workable. \n\nChange the number of channels per node to 5 and it's a little better but you're still in the same basic situation: you can store 7 hops away but destinations are likely 90ish hops away.\n\nIf you use hubs with 1000 channels each, tho, you get a workable system where you need 17,000,000 hubs, each hub can store the entire network topology for other hubs (in about 650mb) and all you'd have to do is ask your destination for their nearest hubs and all your hubs to find routes to one of those. That would only require 2 message exchanges per transaction so pretty scalable. \n\nHowever, with address-based routing, it can be a lot easier to find a route. The trick is how to find *cheap* routes. You can have a 3-channel-each mesh with tree based address routing system that takes N network messages to find a route where N is the length of the route found, but this almost  definitely won't be the cheapest route.

I guess I have to elaborate.  The author makes a number of very flawed arguments.  I do not want to go through it all, but let me take three points in order of increasing severity.\n\n1.  The talk about kinetic and potential energy.  Those terms have a rather specific and well-defined meaning.   Of course, one can use analogy but it requires that the properties of your analogy matches the properties of what you discuss, otherwise the analogy leads to wrong conclusions or just confuse the reader (or both).  \"A bad analogy is like an elephant singing opera: it is not sufficiently orange\".\n  :)\n\n2.  He compares the energy to mine bitcoin with the energy to create gold atoms during nucleosynthesis in a supernova.  Seriously??  Obviously anything is energy efficient compared to the inferno of an exploding star, shining more brightly than a billion suns.\n\n3.  The worst (and in my opinion positively dangerous) argument comes last.  That wasting energy brings us closer to a sustainable society.  It does not, on the contrary.\n\nWe currently struggle to move to towards a sustainable energy sector.  However, it goes slowly, and the main problem is availability of sustainable energy.  In fact, although the *fraction* of energy that comes from sustainable sources increase, the *amount* of non-sustainable energy we use also increase (our energy consumption increase *faster* than we increase the production of sustainable energy)!  \n\nA major and highly important aspect of moving to a sustainable society is energy efficiency!  Every kilojoule used to mine bitcoin, even from sustainable energy sources, will mean one more kilojoule of fossile fuel burned (as the sustainable energy would otherwise have replaced the fossil fuel).\n\nHydroelectrics can only be expanded a little without severe environmental effects (most dams are already there).  Biomass will never play a significant role, a European or American uses energy corresponding to 50 times his own metabolism, and we cannot increase our agricultural sector by a factor 50 (BTW, the bioethanol that we put in our cars is pure greenwash: the farmer used between 80% and 110% of the energy content to produce it!)\n\nThis leaves wind and in particular sun, which has significant potential.  But it requires a lot of energy to produce a windmill or a solar cell.  Every bitcoin mined could be a solar cell not produced  (I am of course myself guilty of stretching analogies here).\n\nI do not think that Bitcoin is yet the ecological disaster that some claim.  But it is certainly getting close.  Personally, this makes me look at proof-of-stake algorithms like they are currently testing in ETH.  It certainly lacks the simplicity and transparency of proof-of-work, but it does not waste as much energy.\n", 10], ["2018-02-18 16:17:48", "Here is a list of threads in other subreddits about the same content:\n\n|Title|Subreddit|Author|Time|Karma|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|[A new outlook on the concept of money: Natural vs Artificial Money and why Bitcoin is the greatest thing to happen for alternative energy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uycj1/a_new_outlook_on_the_concept_of_money_natural_vs/)|/r/Bitcoin|/u/LudvigBitcoinArt|2018-02-03 17:07:35|11|\n|[A new outlook on the concept of money: Natural vs Artificial Money and why Bitcoin is the greatest thing to happen for alternative energy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinAll/comments/7uycj6/a_new_outlook_on_the_concept_of_money_natural_vs/)|/r/BitcoinAll|/u/BitcoinAllBot|2018-02-03 17:07:38|1|\n\n\n----\n\n I am a bot [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuplicatesBot/wiki/index)-[Code](https://github.com/PokestarFan/DuplicateBot)-[Bugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuplicatesBot/comments/6ypgmx/bugs_and_problems/)-[Suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DuplicatesBot/comments/6ypg85/suggestion_for_duplicatesbot/)-[Block user (op only)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=DuplicatesBotBlocker&subject=remove%20user&message=thieflar)-[Block from subreddit (mods only)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=DuplicatesBotBlocker&subject=remove%20subreddit&message=BitcoinDiscussion)\n\nNow you can remove the comment by replying delete!

Not being able to follow fluctuating daily demand is one of the challenges in bringing them to market.  At least, this is my understanding.\n\nI have also heard that, like server databases, Bitcoin mining gravitates toward locations that produce surplus energy, especially during off hours, since it doesn't matter what time of day mining happens.\n\nThere is the argument that Bitcoin mining, compared to other uses of electricity, is more complementary with these renewable sources.  Thus, it can act as a kind of subsidy for them by making them more profitable earlier than they otherwise would be, and stimulating their development.\n\nIt seems you know more than me on this issue, so I'm wondering if what you think of the above argument.

Those terms have a rather specific and well-defined meaning. Of course, one can use analogy but it requires that the properties of your analogy matches the properties of what you discuss\n\nIn context, I found it rather obvious what the energy analogy was trying to convey. I guess I took it for granted that others would, too.\n\nMy interpretation is that the author likens \"saved money/value\" to \"potential energy\", in that while it isn't being spent or used in the moment, it represents the *ability to be spent or converted later*, just like potential energy can later be converted to kinetic energy. Most \"Intro to Physics\" classes explain potential and kinetic energy with the intuitive example of lifting an object a distance above the ground (thereby increasing its *gravitational potential energy*) and then dropping it (converting that energy to *kinetic energy* as it accelerates towards the ground). In the case of money or value, the analogy is that you can *save* your money (thereby increasing your *potential energy of value*) until you finally decide to buy something with it (converting that saved value into goods/services, which is all money is ever ultimately going to be good for).\n\nHopefully this makes the analogy much more understandable. If not, let me know.\n\n>He compares the energy to mine bitcoin with the energy to create gold atoms during nucleosynthesis in a supernova. Seriously?? Obviously anything is energy efficient compared to the inferno of an exploding star, shining more brightly than a billion suns.\n\nI believe that you misunderstood this section rather severely. The author doesn't appear to be trying to argue that \"Bitcoin uses less energy to synthesize than gold, and is therefore more energy-efficient\" (in fact, if anything the *opposite* perspective is adopted; the author seems to believe that ultimately, the synthesis of new gold will be *more* energy-feasible than the synthesis of new bitcoins!).\n\nThe point of bringing up how gold atoms have traditionally been created (via nucleosynthesis in a supernova) is to explain the ultimate underlying source of gold's *scarcity*, and explain that gold has managed to remain scarce (and therefore valuable as a \"natural money\") because **it is extremely energy-expensive to create**.\n\nThe author is *not* trying to say that Bitcoin requiring less energy to create than gold requires is a good thing... they are trying to argue instead that natural monies must be scarce to be valuable, and that high energy costs strongly enforce such scarcity.\n\nThey go on to postulate that one day, we might be able to create arbitrary quantities of gold (presumably because we innovate enough to eventually have enough energy at our disposal to do so), but *no matter how much energy we manage to harness*, we won't be able to decrease the scarcity of bitcoins in the same way; the difficulty adjustment and nature of the system ensures coin scarcity even in the face of new energy capabilities.\n\n>That wasting energy brings us closer to a sustainable society. It does not, on the contrary.\n\nAgain, that's not quite the argument here.\n\nThe argument is something more like: \"By *directly* linking energy to value, Bitcoin economically incentivizes innovation in the energy sector, and generally, meaningful incentivization achieves the best and most efficient results.\" This paraphrasing of the argument is something I think most people would agree with; your version (which I consider a strawman argument) is something that I think most people (including myself) certainly would *not*.\n\nAt risk of sounding rude (which I assure you is not my intention), it sounds like the real problem here was that you didn't really understand what the author was trying to communicate.

And even if that happens, it's likely that the other block also contains the same transaction.\n\nA deliberate double spend attack by 51% of miners (either on their own or because they were bribed) seems more plausible to me, so multiple confirmations are of course still important to protect against this adversarial case (i.e. every confirmation makes it increasingly more expensive to undo your transaction to the point where it's economically infeasible to do so).", 2], ["2018-01-19 09:34:57", "The transaction is \"seen\" by most nodes within seconds of being broadcast. Since it hasn't been included in a block yet at this point (\"confirmed\"), another transaction could show up that spends the same coins, and wind up taking its place. Most nodes will refuse to broadcast that second transaction after they've seen the first (unless the first was tagged with an \"RBF\" flag which signifies that the sender may want to be able to **r**eplace that first one **b**y sending another with a higher **f**ee later on, assuming the first wasn't getting confirmed quickly enough), but importantly, if a block shows up including an alternative transaction which spends those same coins, *all* nodes will accept it just fine. In other words, until the transaction is included/confirmed in at least one Bitcoin block, it is \"up in the air\" and shouldn't be treated as if the payment is complete. It can be replaced with very little cost by a different transaction spending the same coins/inputs as it does.\n\nOnce a block is created which includes that transaction within it, the transaction is **confirmed**. At this point, it's pretty safe to consider the transaction \"processed\" because in order to \"undo\" it (i.e. replace it with a different one spending the same coins), it would require mining **two** Bitcoin blocks before the rest of the network was able to mine **one**. This is a losing proposition (mining blocks is expensive), and it's a relatively rare occurrence. For most types of transactions, it is safe to consider it \"complete\" once they are in a block.\n\nHowever, it's not *impossible* for a different block to be mined, effectively \"rewinding\" or \"undoing\" the transactions in the original block. Each successive block which builds on top of a previous one will add one confirmation to every transaction in that first block *and* to every transaction in blocks underneath *it*. After a couple blocks are mined, adding confirmations on top of that first one, the transaction gets exponentially more expensive and difficult to undo/rewind. The \"6 confirmations\" referred to in the whitepaper is basically a good rule-of-thumb for when you can consider a transaction to be \"practically irreversible\", because without controlling a majority of the Bitcoin network hashrate (i.e. controlling more mining power than *the rest of the world combined*), it's pretty much impossibly unlikely to be able to rewind 6 blocks and \"unconfirm\" any transactions that deep in the blockchain. If you're selling your house or something, and want to be absolutely certain that you're not going to have the coins disappear from your wallet an hour later, it is probably prudent to wait for 6 or more confirmations. For smaller-value transactions, waiting this long would be highly paranoid (and frankly unnecessary).\n\nSorry if that's a lot of information at once.

Section 8 of the Whitepaper seems to discuss this, but i would like to know if this is still true or if we have more information about this.\n\nI think it's  important to keep in mind that the whitepaper is somewhat outdated on this particular topic.  Specifically, Satoshi apparently didn't foresee ASICs and mining pools, so the expectation was that all nodes would run some hashing in the background, which would be somewhat profitable.  Mining is way, way more centralized than what whitepaper seemed to expect.\n\n(Related: this is [an interesting document](https://gist.github.com/harding/dabea3d83c695e6b937bf090eddf2bb3) detailing some of the errors and obsolete information from the whitepaper.)\n\n> Is there a relationship between full node count and decentralization? I know, node count doesn't really matter, what i mean is reasonably spread nodes across different countries, maintained by users and not providers / data-centers.\n\nThis is a really tough question, since there isn't an easily agreed-upon way to quantify decentralization (and [existing attempts to do so](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinDiscussion/comments/7jz899/quantifying_decentralization/) aren't exactly light reading).\n\nI think what most people can agree on, however, is that full nodes that are used by businesses or individuals to actually verify their transactions are much more important than full nodes that don't.\n\nThere is also the fact that if full nodes were prohibitively expensive to run, then the users of the network would have to simply trust the miners.  There's a considerable amount of debate on that point, which I'm not sure OP wants to get into in this thread, but I know that I would prefer a system where I didn't need to trust a mining community, especially considering the alarmingly high centralization of mining today.  Others may feel differently.\n\nIn my personal opinion, I think that having a network where it is trivial to run a full node is important, since it ensures that no single group needs to be relied upon for trust.  Even if not everyone does it, the fact that most users *can* do it seems important to prevent any certain groups from seizing too much influence.\n\nOn a more technical level, I remember there being some last-minute bug fixes to Segwit2x when it was first trying to roll out Segwit during that whole Segwit2x/UASF/BIP91/BitcoinABC clusterfuck back in July.

The cost per unit time of this attack is even asymptotically 0 if the 49% are rational profit-seekers, as they should quickly just give up.\n\nIf miners do use these brute-force methods, it is difficult to see the value of SHA256 hardware increasing, as it will probably break faith in security based on the current mining industry or even in PoW as a concept.  I think it is more realistic to consider miners who care about their reputation, begin politics, fork to a new emission curve, mine both chains, and make at least partially legitimate claims that the new consensus rules are a good thing, more similar to BCC situation.  Suppose also you do not want to trust a checkpoint, and you do not know if the node your light client connects to is lying about which chain it is on.  \n\nAs I understand it, to discover a change in emission, you could just check the coinbase transaction of each block.  And checking that transaction inputs are valid all the way back to when the coins were first generated, with the exception of double-spends, could also be done without downloading full blocks.  \n\nSo, if the other cases are covered, the only reason to need to see full blocks is to look for on-chain double-spends under the assumption that fullnodes are so centralized that nobody in the world tries to publish a fraud proof, or that there is extremely strong censorship of said fraud proof.  This is already back in the category of brute-force methods that require hashpower majority*, but if you have a cartel of nearly 100% of hashpower, then I suppose it could be easier to go unnoticed than a 51% attack, which would leave evidence in the form of decreased network hashrate, even under MITM conditions.\n\n*Technically I guess you could orphan yourself several blocks on purpose by mining on top of a double-spend with less than 51%, and then try to censor the main chain from reaching clients, so it looks like n-conf?  But this strikes me as expensive and implausible.\n\nSo, my impression is that some people other than 5 mining pools should definitely be running fullnodes, in order to make covert on-chain double-spending impractical due to fraud proofs likely getting out and miners suffering the resulting crash in confidence.  I also think sheer number of fullnodes could matter more than the percent in this case.

Minority hash-power (irrespective of how many nodes are backing it) can never *over-rule* miners with majority hash-power. What they can do is force a chain-split and run a minority-chain.\n\n2. You are right about that the economic majority finally gets to decide which chain is more valuable. The economic majority, however, consists of users who own coins, not full-node operators. If miners make egregious changes to consensus rules, the economic majority (users) may decide that new coin has no value (and they may enforce that through trading on exchanges) and ensure that the miners operate at a loss. Running or not running a full-node in this situation still contributes nothing.\n\n    Even if, say, 95% of full-nodes decided to reject the majority hash-power and decided to go with the minority chain, the economic majority (the users) may decide to go with the miners.

What I'm suggesting isn't that they could force a chain-split and run a minority hash power chain, what I'm suggesting is that they could force a chain split into a new chain and run a clear majority hash power with a different PoW function. Maybe SHA256 + some other mining function every other block, or maybe a different algorithm altogether. \n\n>The economic majority, however, consists of users who own coins, not full-node operators.\n\nAlso true. What I would argue is that in the event of a major conflict between miners and node operators, the interests of the economic majority are almost certainly aligned with the broad network of nodes, rather than the relatively smaller set of large mining firms. People run nodes to protect the integrity of the network and their own transactions/the value in the coins they hold; miners have a different set of incentives that don't need to align with the above, longterm. If this assumption is wrong, no amount of nodes trying to split off into their own network makes any difference if there aren't a substantial amount of users who want to place value in their chain.\n\n>Mining works under the condition that there is a working Nash Equilibrium and that miners cannot benefit by changing their strategy.\n\nThis is also exactly my argument. The Nash equilibrium is for miners to mine honestly because attempting to break the rules to benefit themselves risks more loss from getting orphaned than they stand to gain from whatever cheat they could employ. However, *this equilibrium is only true when mining is too decentralized to coordinate reliably to cheat*. \n\nThe white paper made this assumption when describing the system, and in the beginning, before pools, before professional ASIC miners/manufacturers located almost entirely within a single region of the world, it was true. Miners and nodes were one and the same, and they were all over the place, with the expectation that there was no practical way they could all band together to undermine the consensus rules without consensus of the entire system. This is no longer true of the actual, practical bitcoin network today, and efforts to scale in a direction that ends up with all the network mining AND validating done by the same small set of people, with increasingly diverging interests from the average user, and with no threat of being cut out if they misbehave, breaks the \"Honest mining is the nash equilibrium\" assumption.\n\nThere is a lot of room for the practical reality to play out differently than the above (and my holdings are hedged accordingly), but I think it's still a very real concern, and illustrates the need for that inefficient, redundant, less scalable network of non-mining nodes as a real check on the incentive structure of the network.", 2], ["2017-12-23 14:56:02", "Sorry, I should have been clearer.

Since a full-node can still be set up for a cost of $20-$30 on a Raspberry-Pi (which is, at the moment, less expensive than the median transaction fees on the network), a malicious entity could flood the network with thousands of such full-nodes (connected via VPN + Tor) and if the market was going to make their decision looking at node-count, it'd be misled.\n\nI believe this was the primary reason, as briefly described in the whitepaper (in the Proof-of-Work section), Satoshi chose PoW over one-person-one-vote for decision making in Bitcoin.

I'll try to break it down in a comprehensible manner, but it's a rather difficult topic.\n\nLightning is a network of bi-directional channels.\n\nUsing bi-directional channels requires an intricate series of complicated smart contracts exchanged between the two parties.  Only two of these contracts will hit the blockchain as a transaction: one to open the channel, and one to finally close it.\n\nOriginally, it was believed that the opening of such channels required a malleability fix.  This would mean that segwit (or another fix) was strictly required.  Later on, it was discovered that there was another way to open bi-directional channels regardless of malleability, but it requires an even more complicated transactions and exchange process.\n\nKeep in mind that extra overhead with the contracts themselves result in larger transactions that have to go on the blockchain, meaning less capacity per byte and higher fees.  It would also means more required bandwidth between the two parties, though I am unsure if this is a large enough factor to be non-negligible.\n\nBy the way, if you want to get a rough idea of how complicated these contracts are, trying scrolling down and checking out the images in the [Lightning Network whitepaper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf).

However, you cannot be sure about the txid of a regular Bitcoin transaction until it has been added to the blockchain by a miner. That means that you cannot chain unconfirmed transactions - i.e., in case you tried to use the outputs of an unconfirmed transaction (let's call it \"txA\") for a smart contract for a future transaction (let's call it \"txB\"), then txB may fail if the txid of txA ends up being different than what you had expected (this may happen because of different version of nodes used by you and the miner for example). \n\nLightning Network should be implementable without a malleability fix too, but all current working implementations being developed and tested require a malleability fix.", 1], ["2017-11-23 02:56:29", "To add to the last part of this, there's a pretty good semi-technical (semi-laymen) description of how the LN works in the \"So you want to understand the lightning network..\" section here: https://governology.wordpress.com/2017/07/21/so-you-wanna-understand-bitcoin-part-2/", 5], ["2017-11-23 07:40:59", "Thanks!\n\nAlso found this: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5wOqgUjYwc0\n\nWhere Andreas talked about how segwit allows for a third party to monitor lightning transactions between two parties to add safety if one party is offline at the time of the transaction", 3], ["2017-11-26 15:51:36", "Actually, LN doesn't require a malleability fix.  What LN requires is something more difficult: the ability to refer to unsigned transactions.\n\nPrior to SegWit, every transaction included in its txid the transaction's signatures.  That meant that there was no way to refer to unsigned transactions.\n\nWith a SegWit transactions, signatures are separated from the transaction, so the txid does not include it.  It is then possible to refer to an unsigned transaction.\n\nThis has implications not only for LN but for all protocols.  Every protocol can be made (providing the protocol is correctly followed) indistingushable onchain from every other protocol use, and ordinary 2-of-2 multisig addresses.  It is only in case of attack attempts or party failure will the actual protocol get revealed.\n\nThis is done by funding transactions that take the money and put them into 2-of-2 addresses.  A funding transaction is kept unsigned during setup, and start a chain of off-chain transactions.  Once the chain of transactions has been written, they are signed in reverse order, with the funding transaction last.  The protocol finishes setup when the funding transaction is successfully signed and confirmed on the blockchain.\n\nWithout the ability to refer to unsigned transactions, LN channels (and some of the better privacy-preserving atomic swaps, both cross-chain and same-chain (tumbling) swaps) cannot be safely set up in general.  [This mail contains some techniques to make LN channel opening possible without SegWit but notice how all of them have nasty caveats.](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2017-April/000685.html)\n\nIn effect the off-chain transactions simply serve as security to  ensure that the counterparty stalling will allow recovery of funds.  Once the protocol is completed (in LN, channels get closed) both parties are willing to sign a simple spend of the 2-of-2 that gives the money correctly, since both parties have the ability to push transactions on the chain; it's just that using the 2-of-2 provides better privacy for both of them (and improves their fee rate since it'll be smaller than the sequence of transactions they otherwise have to use), so they'll be willing to cooperate.\n\nThat is why Bcash's quixotic attempts to \"fix malleability\" using any technique other than SegWit is misguided: ~~only~~ SegWit allows references to unsigned transactions to be made, with the entire chain made valid in a single step by signing and confirming the first transaction on the chain.  Admittedly, [FlexTrans](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0134.mediawiki) would also work, but requires a hardfork.  Also, [BIP140](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0140.mediawiki) would also work and is a softfork, but adds fewer advantages than SegWit does.\n\nThe fact that SegWit fixes malleability completely by separating signatures from transactions is secondary, the primary thing is that it should be possible to write chains of transactions without signing them, then signing them in reverse order, with the step of signing the first transaction atomically making the entire chain valid.", 3], ["2017-12-01 04:56:50", "> only SegWit allows references to unsigned transactions to be made\n\n[FlexTrans BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0134.mediawiki)\n\n> The TxId is calculated by taking the serialized transaction without the Signatures and the TxEnd and hashing that.\n\nAm I misunderstanding something?", 1], ["2017-12-01 07:24:02", "FlexTrans requires a hardfork, unlike SegWit, and adds a lot of flexibility that is unlikely to be necessary.

At least consolidation of your UTXOs is cheaper.  I often do consolidation during low fee periods to help future spends become cheaper, this improvement actually helps make consolidations even cheaper.\n\n>Out of curiosity, did HF-segwit have witness discount?

If you start a loan at a certain interest, you pay a certain amount each month for a certain amount of time.

I'm not saying the interest **rate** is calculated month by month, I'm saying the **interest owed** is calculated month by month (or continuously or whatever). Eg if you have a 6%/year interest rate on a $1000 loan, you pay $5 interest that month.

Right?\n\nIt seems to me that you agree with me in cases where the loan is paid off all at once at the end, right? I'll assume you agree with that so far. \n\nSo, what if the borrower takes two loans with 5% real interest on Jan 1st: one for $500 from lender A and another for $500 from lender B. If the borrower pays off lender A on Feb 1st and lender B on March 1st, does my logic still hold? Does it change things if the borrower is taking both loans from the same lender? \n\nIf you're still disagreeing that my logic holds for loans with multiple payouts, what's an example where it doesn't hold?

The bank can loan out money below the inflation rate precisely because of two facts:\n\n* Banks are not allowed to create money and give it to themselves as payment\n* Banks *are* allowed to create money and give it to someone else as a loan, and take the interest payments for themselves as payment. \n\nIf banks could simply print money and use it however they want to, they would also not be willing to lend out money below the inflation rate, since they'd lose money.

I tried with the car example, but that didn't seem to do the job. I'll make an example as non-related to what we've been talking about as possible: Say you want to buy a new car but don't have the money. You can get a really good interest rate at the bank. However your aunt is terminally ill and in really bad condition. You know you're going to inherit a lot of money.

What differences do you mean?\n\nI compare the incentive of taking a loan in an inflationary world vs deflationary world. In both worlds the incentives are there, but they're not equal. In the end you'll end up with different amounts of value for different inflation numbers. Reason why is explained below.\n \n> Every loan can be simplified to a series of single pay-outs and pay-offs. There is no possible way that multiple pay outs or pay offs can have different economics. Could you explain how you disagree?\n\nWhen you pay-off or get payed-out you do it at the inflation rate of that given time. In the example of the investment you gave, you're going to get a profit. That profit has a certain value. When the same thing happens next month/year, you get a profit again. However, the previous profit you had also suffers/gains from the inflation rate, and that's not accounted for. That's money that leaves the equation making it non-zero sum. The only way we can make it zero-sum again is if we account for that inflation by making it obligated to save up all the profit until the end of the loan/investment.  \n The same is true for when you pay-off a loan. The only way we can make it zero-sum is like in your example where we have all the money upfront. However, in practice that's usually not the case.\n \n> I'm not sure what you mean.

That's the entire point, you take away a small value from everyone and give it in a form of a loan to people who can't start a business, go to school, etc. You don't take away $10k from one person to loan it to another, you take $10 from 1000 people and loan it to one person who by definition is using it to invest.\n \n> I believe we've talked about this already, right?

If so, fine, fair enough. I can work with that. \n\n> I compare the incentive of taking a loan in an inflationary world vs deflationary world.

In my example, no matter what the inflation is, the lender is giving loans at 5% real (inflation adjusted) interest rate. What's an example of two different inflation rates where the incentives would cause different behavior given that 5% real interest rate? We've already agreed that all the lender cares about is the real interest payments received, so I think we can agree that (all else being equal) if the lender is willing to lend out a 5% interest-rate loan in one inflationary environment, they'd be willing to lend it out at that interest rate in another unless there is less than -5% inflation (ie greater than 5% deflation). Right? \n\n> When you pay-off or get payed-out you do it at the inflation rate of that given time.\n\nI believe we agreed that offsetting the interest rate can account for inflation for any loan where you pay off the entire thing all at once.

Because what I'm saying is that, let's say you have a $10,000 loan where you pay off $1000/month. In this scenario, you can break those down into 10 separate loans, where each loan is paid off in full - one where you do it the first month, one where you do it the second month, etc etc. So if we agreed on the above, we should also agree on the more complicated case of periodic payments (whether regular or irregular). \n\n\n", 1], ["2018-04-06 04:12:15", "> you think entire teams of people with degrees in finance and years of experience are just as good investors then John Doe?\n\nI think people with degrees in finance are good at certain types of investments, but if we gave all of our money to them, innovation would grind to a halt.

The investment opportunities you're aware of and can take advantage of are different from what I'm aware of and can do. If I can't find any investment that's better than inflation, its better for the economy for me to sit on my money, but with inflation its better for *me* if I still invest it. This represents an economic loss, and that's the root of my argument.\n\nBut let's take a step away from that and figure out what you think would be ideal. If banks are better at investing than everyone else, why limit them to just taking money via inflation? Why not subsidize them with public money? Where would the limit to that be?

There are currently two possible investments in a hypothetical economy:\n\n* A traditional farm that produces 1050 2018 dollars worth of grain per month for 1000 2018 dollars of labor and materials, and\n* A new type of farm that produces 1100 2018 dollars worth of grain per month for 1000 2018 dollars of labor and materials\n\nGroup A knows about the traditional farm but doesn't know (or doesn't believe in, which is functionally equivalent to not knowing) the new type of farm. Group B knows about and believes in the new type of farm. There is no inflation in the economy and it takes 1 month for price information to fully propagate through the market (the result of which is a gradual daily decrease or increase in price levels). Both groups have been investing in traditional farming for the past 10 years and things have reached equilibrium. Its now 2019, both groups have $100,000 (2018) to invest. \n\nNow let's compare two scenarios: \n\n1. Group A invests all his money in traditional farming as usual while Group B invests all his money in the new type of farming\n2. Same as scenario 1 except that Group A decides to only invest $90,000 in traditional farming (saving $10,000 for later) \n\n[I made a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fht143Se3guD1hCMuLTWWj3kmjodsK5An-jAY8RiAy0/edit?usp=sharing) that makes this a bit more complex with the inputs being labor, and outputs being grain, and the price level being adjusted slowly as the information propagates through the market. These two scenarios can be extracted from this sheet by doing the following:\n\nScenario 1: \n\n* Change \"money that has stopped circulating\" to 0\n* Change the \"Initial Investment Budget\" to $50,000\n* Change the \"Investment Type\" to A\n* Note the real net worth at the end of day 389 ($50,000)\n* Change the \"Investment Type\" to B\n* Note the real net worth at the end of day 389 ($164,229)\n\nScenario 2: \n\n* Change \"money that has stopped circulating\" to $10,000\n* Change the \"Investment Type\" to A\n* Change the \"Initial Investment Budget\" to **$40,000** (ie 50,000 minus the money that has stopped circulating)\n* Note the real net worth at the end of day 389 ($42,070)\n* Add the currency that was not invested ($10,000 @ a price level of .9 = $11,111) for a total of $53,181\n* Change the \"Investment Type\" to B\n* Change the \"Initial Investment Budget\" to **$50,000**\n* Note the real net worth at the end of day 389 ($172,729)\n\nIf you do this, you get $50,000+$164,229 = $214,229 of real economic net worth for the economy in scenario 1, and $42,070+$11,111+$172,729 = $225,910 of real economic net worth for the economy in scenario 2. \n\nNot only that, but the amount of grain actually produced was higher as well (tho not by as much as the net monetary result):\n\nScenario 1: 50,000 tons +164,229 tons = 214,229 tons\nScenario 2: 42,070 tons+172,729 tons = 214,799 tons\n\nThis clearly shows how someone not using their *currency* can increase the economy's wealth.

You are overlooking or unaware of what the scaling solutions could be. Furthermore, the large miners don't just have more money, they probably have better technology.

The codebreakers were equally dependent on math, programing and HARDWARE. They built some of the first computers, highly classified work, so for years no one knew about it.

Both of these approaches are still in the early stages of development and it's pure speculation to say which is better.

If I had to throw out one of the properties, it would be the lack of inflation, especially since we don't even know for sure if Bitcoin's incentive structure still works as the block reward approaches zero.

The Bitcoin-holders these costs would be \"externalized\" to have been freeloading.  People already sometimes lend money to banks at negative nominal interest rates, so storing value is clearly something people are willing to pay for.  And right now, the cost is being paid by others.  Once coins are stored in an output, miners work forever to secure it under stronger and stronger incentives by continuing to mine more blocks on top of it, fullnodes have to keep track of it in their UTXO set, etc.  The network continues to do this work for free up to and until the coins are moved.  By comparison, frequently moved coins, such as those handled by exchanges, pay the same fees per transaction, but have worse security properties, and there is less work done on securing them.  The implication that you \"should\" only pay to transact, and not to hold, on some sort of philosophical grounds, rather than a consequence of how the system was designed, is quite strange to me.*\n\nClearly there is an extra social cost to moving coins, in that transaction volume uses block space which decreases security and/or usability for everyone.  So obviously transaction fees \"should\" not be zero.  But, in a perfectly fair system, neither should it cost zero to hold coins for years.  This suggests a certain nonzero rate of emission (possibly extremely small) would be more fair than none at all.  Similar but maybe even more internally fair would be a small flat demurrage fee per UTXO per block, rather than the percent-based tax inflation imposes.  \n\n*This is strictly independent of any economic view that money-hoarding in general has a social cost, which I think it also does, but you do not have to accept that premise.", 6], ["2017-12-18 19:24:12", "Out of interest, why don't you think it will end well?

To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)\n\nGiven that k = 1.38\u00d710-16erg/\u00b0Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2\u00b0Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2\u00b0K would consume 4.4\u00d710-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.\n\nNow, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21\u00d71041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7\u00d71056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all of its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.\n\nBut that\u2019s just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.\n\nThese numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.\"", 1], ["2017-12-11 05:59:48", "A bitcoin private key is simply a number, so quantum computing would break that as well. \n\nThe [Large Bitcoin Collider](https://lbc.cryptoguru.org/about) is a coordinated effort to brute force find private keys.

But is it really easy to assume that nobody will mine them?  What if the double-spend's fee is really big?  And how much will it hurt the miner's long term profits?  For example, consumers constantly get away with fraud on paypal because it is trivial to execute, and many merchants accept paypal anyway.  \n\nA miner with X% hashpower could make a certain profit, Y% of the normal income, from mining double-spends, while only affecting the overall quality of bitcoin 0-conf service by X%.  In the limiting case where mining is completely decentralized, it seems clear enough that the tragedy of the commons can occur because a small miner could increase profits by the same percentage, Y%, while lowering the value of bitcoin by ~0%.

Is it good to trust mining pool centralization to solve the problem, and not in 100% of cases, but only for the blocks that are actually mined by the large pools?

A blocksize increase just aims to provide an immediately increase to throughput.  And for this very narrow goal, yes, it would accomplish it better than segwit would.\n\nThe main purpose of segwit was to solve the issue of transaction malleability, which was a bug in bitcoin that seriously hindered the development of layer 2 systems being built on top of the blockchain.  It also comes with some other benefits, including a modest blocksize increase via soft fork, and reducing the problem of UTXO bloat.\n\nThere is also the issue of negative tradeoffs for increasing the blocksize.  There are two big ones that concern me.\n\nThe first, which you have already brought up, concerns the resource requirements to run a full node.  I believe that the entire blockchain is approach about 200GB in size, which needs to be kept in storage.  But this is only about the 3rd or 4th biggest cost concern for full nodes.  Doubling the blocksize strongly increases bandwidth and processing costs for validating new transactions.  On top of this, a full node needs to store the UTXO set in memory.  The UTXO set is consistently growing, but this is a particular problem at the moment bceause non-segwit transactions make it cheaper to break a larger UTXO into smaller ones than it is to combine smaller ones into a single larger one. Segwit at least partially helps this issue, making a blocksize increase safer.\n\nNow, the increased cost to full nodes is definitely an issue, but there is a greater problem with mining centralization.\n\nLarger blocks take longer to propagate throughout the network, so this has a centralizing effect on mining.  This is because if a block has been created, then every second you are waiting for it to reach you, that is time that the creator of the block is mining for the  next block, and you are wasting energy.\n\nFor the last point of comparison between segwit and a blocksize increase, lets consider the long term goal.  Most of us agree that the goal is to be able to scale bitcoin to global levels, or at least to credit-card levels.  Right now we're at around 4tx/s.  VISA handles thousands per second, during holiday times, this can reach the 10 000s.  Considering that's where we want to get, some simple math shows that blocksize increases aren't going to do it.  Going from 4tx/s to 8tx/s is completely negligible when we're trying to achieve several orders of magnitude in scaling.  It could be argued that every little bit helps, but then it needs to be weighed against the costs I described above.  And considering that it involves compromising the security and decentralized nature of the system (which gives it its value in the first place), it seems clear to me that we have to seek an alternative path.\n\nI think that other path is through 2nd layer systems, like lightning network, which have the potential to scale hundreds of time better, but without harming Bitcoin's underlying value.\n\nI hope that helps, let me know if you'd like me clarify anything.  I'll answer your question about segwit2x in another post.", 6], ["2017-10-03 22:04:56", "Ok, finally getting around to this one!\n\n> Lastly, I really don't understand all the opposition and vitriol against 2x. If the vast majority of miners are signaling for it, and it's just SegWit with [a little bit] bigger blocks, what's the problem?\n\nSegwit2x is the result of the New York Agreement signed earlier this year.  The implementation is called btc1.  So if you see 2x, segwit2x, NYA, or btc1, that generally all refers to the same thing.\n\nOther than the general reasons to oppose bigger blocks (as I detailed in my other comments), there are several technical reasons and one non-technical reason that I and others oppose segwit2x.\n\n---------------\n\nFirst, the non-technical reason, which is how the agreement was made, and how it is being pushed.  The agreement was signed after a closed-door meeting without public comment or input.  The participants are made up mostly of different miners (which make up about 90% of the hashrate, which is why you'll see 90% quoted so often), and exchanges and businesses, most of which have been invested in by Barry Silbert, who arranged the meeting.\n\nThe agreement was made that this change would be forced upon the network, regardless of how the other parts of the community felt.  It had near unanimous opposition from the core development team, and a large body of other users and businesses oppose it, so it entirely lacks consensus.\n\n------------------\n\nTechnical reasons:\n\n- It is very rushed.  A hard-fork for the entire ecosystem needs to be done on a timeline that allows adequate testing and gives the different parts of the community time enough to upgrade.  Segwit2x does no such thing.  And because it was so lacking in developer support, it has had not nearly enough people working on it to allow for adequately safe testing and development.\n\n- There has been a great deal of research done in Bitcoin to determine the best procedure for a hardfork (see spoonnet), and what problems should be solved ([here's a wishlist](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardfork_Wishlist)).  A hardfork presents a great amount of risk, but also a big opportunity to fix a lot of smaller errors and bugs, and improve efficiencies that could not be done with a softfork.  Segwit2x completely throws away this opportunity.\n\n- The big one: replay protection.  When the network splits into two chains, there is a big problem in that when you send a transaction, it gets sent on *both* chains, unless there are certain changes implemented to prevent this.  These changes are called replay protection.  Segwit2x *purpose* does not implement full replay protection, which unnecessarily makes the fork more dangers to user and businesses, and presents a big mess to developers who now have to work around this.  Notice I said 'full' replay protection in that last sentence.  This is because they are implementing 'opt-in' replay protection.  This means that only people on the segwit2x chain can make transactions that are replay-protected.  Transactions on the non-2x chain will not be protected from double-spend attacks.", 3], ["2017-10-02 21:28:37", "This seems pretty relevant:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/73pbbg/why_chaincode_labs_being_one_of_the_biggest_core/\n\nI think Flash Boys should be required reading for anyone trying to understand HFT and why we need to get away from centralized currencies and markets as soon as possible!", 0], ["2017-10-02 20:38:15", "Thanks for the reply.

(And I haven't forgotten about the segwit2x questions...)\n\nOk, let's consider a doubling of blocksize then.  \n\n-----------\n\nFirst, lets talk full nodes:\n\nThere is rather high demand for Bitcoin and transactions space in blocks, so I think it is reasonable to assume that the 2x blocks would fill up in short order, so lets imagine a scenario where Bitcoin is functioning the same as now, but we have full blocks at twice the size.\n\nThe first thing is a doubling in the bandwidth cost, and required processing power.\n\nThe memory required to store the UTXO set is already growing, but it would likely start going at *twice the speed*.  Even with blocks at current sizes, we will need continually growing memory capabilities.  2x blocks means that it will grow at twice the speed.\n\nThe last concern is raw storage.  This isn't as big a problem, but shouldn't be completely handwaved.  With widespread segwit adoption, under current rules they estimate blocks will reach at least around 1.5MB.  If we double that, we'll get 3MB blocks every 10 minutes.  That means 150GB of extra storage needed every year.  That's not insurmountable, but should be considered.\n\nNow, people will still be able to run full nodes with those extra costs, but it will be a smaller proportion.  What percentage of full nodes would stop running if this happened?  It's hard to say, but I think that guessing that 1/20 nodes stop running would be a very conservative estimate.  So, let's assume *at least* a 5% drop in the proportion of full nodes to users.\n\nNow, lets look at what we have gained a doubling of transaction throughput.  That sounds pretty good when phrased like that, but remember to zoom out - to achieve our goals, we need to get 10 000s of times more throughput.  So, for far, far less than 1% of the scaling we need, we need to sacrifice at least 5% of our node decentralization.\n\nThat seems like a really bad deal.  Especially when there are alternatives available.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe other issue is miner centralization.\n\nCurrently, most mining happens in China, and pools controlled by a single company make up more than a third of hashpower.  This is a problem.  Currently, this means that a single government has the ability to wreak serious havoc on the system if it were to choose.  Doubling the blocksize would mean that blocks would take even longer to propagate so it would make this situation work.\n\nI don't actually know if it would double the required propagation time or not, but it certainly would result in increased centralization pressure.\n\nSo again, we must ask, is this worth the trade-off of benefits in terms of scaling?\n\nIt seems clear to me that we need to pursue other options instead.", 2], ["2017-10-04 21:47:33", "That would be nice.", 1], ["2017-10-03 01:36:02", "I guess we have to wait and see.

For example, I think you could easily find a place where electricity costs are such that, if you are so hyper sensitive to costs, it could make sense to upgrade my circa ~2011 giant paperweight to a smaller newer, more energy efficient computer.  There are plenty of places where the computer I'm using could cost >=500 EUR per annum in electricity to run 24/7.\n\nExample of a cheap small efficient computer: https://www.lifewire.com/dell-inspiron-3050-micro-833331 for less than $200. You would have to add storage or transfer a pre-pruned blockchain (for example from your  old paperweight) but this is a brand new 2017 computer, there are no rules about using old or used hardware to save money.\n\n>Remember, it's the not the average person who stops running a node when the cost goes up, it's the people currently running nodes who have the lowest available resources.

I don't know if 2x would mean it's not worth it for me, but something higher like 4x or 8x would almost certainly mean I'd have to just shut it down.\n\nMaybe, but eventually you're going to upgrade your hardware.  A growing network with lots of new users will mean new nodes too. As the network grows and mainstream usage of bitcoin grows there will be more reasons and incentives for new players to get involved and some of them will want to run full nodes for various reasons.\n\n>This would matter if we're talking about raw numbers of nodes, but decentralization is a proportional measurement. So if the network grows by 20%, we need a 20% increase in the number nodes to stay as decentralized.

But this piece of your argument is starting to sound like *\"No, don't let the network **grow**, we won't have enough nodes to be sufficiently decentralized\"- I simply do not agree with that position and I haven't read any good supporting evidence or arguments supporting it yet.  I am not a mathematician but I'm sure that those that are can build some models that show a range in the number of nodes required for X participants to achieve certain levels of \"decentralization\".  Like everything else there must be diminishing returns above a certain number and there must be a threshold above which losing a node or two is not catastrophic.  Have you read any such research that suggests that were are on the cusp of something bad happening if we lose just a few nodes?\n\n>So, you seem to think that 5% is too high a number of people who are priced out. Alright then. In that case: Please suggest what proportion of nodes you think would be priced out. Then we can talk about how likely that is, and whether or not it's worth the trade-off for scaling.\n\nFirst, I do not think an appreciable number of nodes *would* be priced out by a doubling of the block size in the first place. In fact, I think there is a good chance that block size increases would have beneficial enough effects to attract new entrants.\n\nI don't think most of the people that run bitcoin nodes are so ultra sensitive to price increases that they will shut their node down if their costs go up by $1 or $2 per month either.  Plus, Moore's law dictates that if they are temporarily out of the game today, they could be back in the game soon when they finally upgrade their super old, outdated hardware. As far as I can tell, it's only people with very old, slow, tired hardware that would be completely unable to run a node with a block size doubling, especially since prune mode is now a thing.\n\nI have yet to read a rational well-reasoned argument that suggests that a simple block size doubling would lead to a loss of enough nodes to cause some kind of catastrophic centralization.  In fact I think swift decisions to help bitcoin to scale will probably lead to an increase in users and nodes.\n\nRegardless of what is done with the block size, average every day users are going to become less and less likely to be running full nodes, it's simply not convenient.  I would blame convenience factor and availability of alternatives for any loss of nodes before I would blame cost increases.  Pruning helps make running full nodes easier (but also removes the argument storage space being a significant cost factor) but it doesn't help enough to make a full node good for an average user.  Full node growth will come from small businesses, enthusiasts, etc.  The costs may be going up a tiny bit, but I think Moore's law is offsetting them.  \n\nIf you can run a full node today on a ~7 year old CPU on less than $100 worth of hardware (to the extent it has any street value at all it's so old), I just can't see how any one can argue doubling the blocks will cause catastrophic cost increases and catastrophic costs of nodes. For all we know this piece of junk may still run a full node after 2x, same goes for the cheapest budget VPS servers.  \n\nDo people think that there are a huge number of nodes running in India that were assembled from hardware found in a junk yard powered powered by an army of villagers riding bicycles?  I mean come on, how can anybody make this argument with a straight face?  I just really don't understand it because the level of hardware that can still run this today even with the network all clogged up is just laughable to me. The PC I am running this on was not even high end when *new* 6+ years ago.\n\nIf you have some new hard numbers to add I'm all ears, but otherwise I think we'll have to respectfully agree to disagree.\n\nFor fun I'm taking a snapshot of the full node picture as of today, October 4, 2017: \n\nArchive.is: http://archive.is/dcSHt\n\nScreenshot: https://s1.postimg.org/6jthbpo8pb/coin_dance.png\n\n", 0], ["2017-10-04 16:19:00", "Ok.

Thanks for checking out our community and contributing!  :)\n\nThis was an interesting read, especially the comments.  I appreciate you resurrecting it, have an upvote.\n\nPerhaps there was a different atmosphere going on when this was originally posted, but I don't know who it's responding to.  My first thought upon seeing the title was...of course segwit isn't meant to be an on-chain scaling solution.  It is first and foremost a malleability fix to help with 2nd layer solutions.\n\nIt certainly does offer some extra bonuses that give a modest boost to on-chain scaling, so maybe that's where the confusion is coming from, but I don't think anyone is seriously claiming that it's meant to accomplish the exact same thing as as a simple blocksize increase.  It is tempting to dismiss the title as a straw-man, but for the sake of good conversation, let's give the author the benefit of a doubt and call it an honest misunderstanding.\n\nAs for the individual points, I was going to start responding, but then I noticed that /u/luke-jr had [already done so quite thoroughly](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4aoan6/segwit_is_not_an_onchain_scaling_solution_a/d12ug33/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=btc), so I'll just quote him right here:\n\n> 1 - Pruned nodes are fully validating nodes. They do not lose any security by pruning their blockchain storage.\n\n> 2 - While the storage size of SegWit blocks is the same as with a HF block size increase, the CPU time is not. SegWit blocks verify much faster because the hashing of signed data grows linear instead of exponentially.\n\n> 3 - Additionally, SegWit makes increasing the block size even safer by retaining the current limits on UTXO growth (although it makes practical what is currently only theoretical growth).\n\n> 4 - SegWit does not move data out of blocks.\n\n> 5 - SegWit does not require data to be stored (it does not break pruning, which again, can still be a full node).\n> 6 - Discarding/pruning signatures is not equivalent to checkpointing.\n> 7 - Nodes which choose never to download signatures is equivalent to checkpointing, and makes them not a full node. It is a level between a SPV node and full node, and perhaps more importantly: such a node can be upgraded to from a SPV node, and can upgrade itself to a full node. In other words, nodes can use this to start faster and still achieve full node security by finishing the sync in the background.\n\n> 8 - While overall block size increase depends on wallets (not nodes) upgrading, those wallets which choose to upgrade get the increase available immediately. Only old wallets are limited to the old block size limit.\n\n> 9 - SegWit requires only miner nodes to upgrade; other nodes should upgrade to retain full node security. Hardforks of any kind require every single node to upgrade, and if any do not, they are left completely vulnerable; if any significant portion of the economy fails or refuses to upgrade, the hardfork itself fails and the economy is split between Bitcoin and a new altcoin (arguments over which side is the altcoin are irrelevant). Please compare apples to apples, not to carrots.\n\n> 10 - SegWit has multiple BIPs because of the scope of the change, not because of its complexity (it's quite simple, really). Rather than having a single BIP covering the change from every layer, it was decided to have each different layer of the protocol have a dedicated BIP describing how the change affects that layer.\n\n> 11 - A \"constant change\" is not safe due to aforementioned exponential CPU time increases. Even BIP 109 (aka Classic) has much more complex rules than simply changing a constant to try to (poorly) address these issues.\n\n> 12 - While both softforks and hardforks compel nodes to upgrade when they have supermajority support (it's debatable if majority is sufficient here), nodes which fail or choose not to upgrade still behave better in the softfork scenario than the hardfork. With a softfork, they continue to function with reduced security (still better than light wallets, mind you), whereas in a hardfork they are left entirely vulnerable to attack, with not even the same security as light wallets. Again, compare apples to apples.\n\n> 13 - Since the transaction ids no longer commit to the signatures with SegWit, it does require an additional commitment to the full transaction data. However, this commitment is required whether or not it is a softfork or a hardfork. A hardfork could be slightly cleaner by putting this in the block header rather than the generation/coinbase transaction, but doing so would break all existing mining hardware (because the header would become 112 bytes instead of 80, and they all hard-wire the 80-byte size). Putting it in the generation transaction not only makes a softfork possible, it is also necessary to avoid breaking miners. Note that the size is also negligible - it's a minimum of 32 bytes, and only 5 bytes more to make it an OP_RETURN in the generation transaction.", 6], ["2017-05-17 23:18:25", "This is patently false.\n\nHere is hard evidence that disputes it:\n\nWe've got blocks on the testnet with [over 8800 transactions](https://testnet.smartbit.com.au/block/0000000000000896420b918a83d05d028ad7d61aaab6d782f580f2d98984a392) in them.  \n\nThere are also examples of testnet blocks loaded with large multisig transactions, totaling [3.7mb](https://testnet.smartbit.com.au/block/00000000000016a805a7c5d27c3cc0ecb6d51372e15919dfb49d24bd56ae0a8b).

One thing to consider about that, however, is that it wouldn't reduce one of the major pressures to centralize, which are related to block propagation times. Its unclear to me how much centralization pressure currently exists in mining. It seems very plausible to me that centralization has happened simply because bitcoin is still new and there just aren't a ton of players in the market. \n\nI also have gotten very interested in hybrid PoW/PoS protocols, so much so that I [wrote one myself](https://github.com/fresheneesz/proofOfTimeOwnership).

Anyone buying miners from Bitmain is *funding their competition*, since Bitmain is a large miner as well. Competition would also drive down the price of miners and increase the rate of innovation. Since mining chips are nearing the feature size limits of silicon, innovation will probably consist mostly of increasing efficiency and production capacity.

While they admit to being the primary investor and funder of ViaBTC, the official statement that Bitmain has given is that \"Bitmain and ViaBTC only share an investment relationship in which ViaBTC operates independently. The founder of ViaBTC has ten times the voting rights as those of the investors of ViaBTC.\"\n\nWhen ViaBTC started to support BCC mining alongside BTC mining, they tweeted about an upcoming \"smart Bitcoin mining service\" and someone tweeted them back asking whether they could choose what they mine, to which @AntPoolBITMAIN responded with a \"Yes, you decide which coin to mine\" (seemingly accidentally responding from the wrong Twitter account and inadvertently adding more evidence to support the theory that ViaBTC is indeed run by Bitmain).\n\nFurthermore, on April 2, 2017 a large portion of the hashrate from AntPool, ViaBTC, and BTC.top was redirected (from the stratum settings of the local machines themselves) to F2Pool by an anonymous hacker. While this was fixed fairly quickly, the fact that these three pools all fell victim in the exact same way (in a manner that seems to indicate that their stratum settings are most likely being managed from the same datacenter), combined with the fact that these three pools invariably agree with one another and push the same narrative (namely, whatever Bitmain supports at the time) is a pretty damning piece of evidence.\n\nJihan Wu's official statement regarding BTC.top is that Bitmain do *not* own them (\"Bitmain and http://Btc.top does not have any equity holding relationship.

Miners were (I assume) largely behind the segwit disinformation campaign presumably because they viewed it as not in their interest. The same will go for introducing new mining schemes.

The original plan was also to have zero or very low fees until coinbase rewards expired (as can be ascertained from various sources such as the whitepaper, early emails and posts on Bitcoin forums and mailing lists, marketing on the official bitcoin.org website, etc).

Only analyzes transfer time (doesn't consider latency or verification time and doesn't consider factors relevant to non-mining full nodes). It also assumes that 4MB was previously safe without providing any supporting evidence and invalidly extrapolates from that. Many people aren't convinced that the 2.5MB the protocol currently allows (with 100% segwit adoption) is safe. \n2. This line calls the entire test into question: \"*bigger blocks were four times faster than the small, main-chain blocks. I don't know why*\". Until that's figured out *and* fixed, these results are questionable. Also his criteria that \"*somebody running a decent personal computer on a pretty good home network connection should be able to run a full node*\" is actually not anywhere near conservative enough. I would amend that to say that somebody running a computer that is as powerful as the 10th or 20th or so percentile of personal computers should be able to run a full node without significantly affecting the performance of their computer to day to day tasks (ie excluding games or other programs with larger resource requirements). This is a couple orders of magnitude more conservative than Gavin's criteria. \n3. Useful, but I find it strange that you focused on the 50th percentile rather than the 90th percentile. Actually we should care about the 95th percentile. You said \"If we assume 1% to be an appropriate orphan rate, we can have avg. block propagation times of around 6.03s.\" But at the 90th percentile, we're already consistently exceeding 6.03 seconds. \n4. I wasn't able to find any evaluation of his simulation techniques, but he does mention that \"*0.3% is in the noise, miner profitability varies much more than that from week to week*\". Statements like that really don't add to his credibility. A 0.3% advantage is huge in the long run - profit variance is irrelevant if you consistently do 0.3% better than other miners. As profit margins drop, that 0.3% can cut a deep hole in the profits of miners that are at that disadvantage. And *any* consistent measurable advantage for a mining pool basically means that it'll be the only mining pool anyone connects to. \n5. That miner's comments does not at all \"show\" that larger blocksizes would not lead to mining centralization. It simply asserts it. What it does show is that the cost of bandwidth isn't a significant factor in miner profitability. And I'm not sure if anyone's seriously proposed that a miner's personal bandwidth resources was ever a major issue. \n6. 7, 8, 9, 10 - I see what you're implying with these, but it doesn't get us any closer to figuring out what level of resource is appropriate to foster a decentralized set of miners and full-nodes. \n\nI agree that having data like this is compelling, and I wish I knew where I could find more data like this. The about 3 significant simulations and tests I've seen simply don't cover enough ground to make a clear determination in my opinion. The gigablock testnet was the most interesting test, but I haven't heard anything from it for a few months and last I heard it was still in progress. More links to different test would be much appreciated if you know how to find them!\n\n> Please tell me how that makes sense. The proportion of users running a node is absolutely irrelevant!!\n\nThe number of full nodes is actually irrelevant. The reason something like a user-activated soft fork works is because if an economic majority (or better yet, supermajority) is using new rules, miners that don't then follow those new rules will no longer be mining the longest chain. So number of full-nodes doesn't matter. And the proportion of full-nodes that *aren't* making transactions at the moment also doesn't matter. Only the proportion of full-nodes that are creating transactions matters. Any SPV node is giving their economic power to the full-node they connect to. \n\n> Your logic would dictate the the former network is more decentralized by a factor of 10! And that would be wrong.\n\nI'm a little flabbergasted here. A 5 user network where all 5 users are equals is literally 100% decentralized - maximum decentralization. It is in fact much harder to build larger decentralized networks but more users does not == more decentralization. I'm pretty confused why you think it would mean that. \n\n> But I don't think you are making any attempts at putting forward reasonable arguments.\n\nI'm sorry you think that.

I think that a lot of nodes should not be running. They make the network much more inefficient than it could be and do not contribute anything of value.\n\nThere are about ~150,000 non-listening in the Bitcoin network (according to some sources, which may or may not be reliable) which do absolutely nothing but download data from other nodes. These make it more expensive to run listening nodes (of which there are only ~10,000) and also make the process of block propagation and transaction propagation slower over the whole network. These should absolutely *not* be running.\n\nListening nodes are sort of fine. But unless they are doing a lot of transactions themselves or are connected to a lot of SPV wallets, they do not really add anything of value to anybody. It's cool to be able to run them but they are disposable. Nodes that handle a lot of transactions, like nodes run by businesses and exchanges, are useful. And these should be sustainable by the profits from the businesses running them. \n\n> Many people (including myself) believe that a node should be easily run by almost anyone, \"inefficient\" or not.\n\nI'd love to run a node too. But I don't see why I should expect to run one for almost free especially when even a single transaction costs a lot of money in fees.... I recognize that running a node adds almost nothing of value to anyone, including myself, so I don't expect the whole network to stagnate just to maintain my ability to run a node for free.\n\n> Only analyzes transfer time (doesn't consider latency or verification time and doesn't consider factors relevant to non-mining full nodes). It also assumes that 4MB was previously safe without providing any supporting evidence and invalidly extrapolates from that. Many people aren't convinced that the 2.5MB the protocol currently allows (with 100% segwit adoption) is safe.\n\nIt took the 4MB time from the paper we were talking about. Even if you disregard that, and you consider only 1 MB to be safe, then you'd still get 5MB instead of 20MB. (And still not even considering off-protocol improvements like the relay network.)\n\nLatency affects block propagation time, so it's not required to be considered twice. And verification times aren't considered because they don't affect orphan rate.\n\n> Also his criteria that \"somebody running a decent personal computer on a pretty good home network connection should be able to run a full node\" is actually not anywhere near conservative enough. I would amend that to say that somebody running a computer that is as powerful as the 10th or 20th or so percentile of personal computers should be able to run a full node without significantly affecting the performance of their computer to day to day tasks (ie excluding games or other programs with larger resource requirements). This is a couple orders of magnitude more conservative than Gavin's criteria. \n\nWhy not make it a criteria that it should be possible to run a node on very low-end smartphones on a 2G connection? (That should enable nearly all of the world's population to run a node if they were so inclined.)\n\nI mean that as a serious question. Do you think it will be preferable over the present situation? If yes, why? And if not, why?\n\n(As for the other point that you brought up... I guess the primary objective of the test was to see if the Core client implementation could handle larger blocks without problems and accidental chain splits, essentially just checking for bugs that could cause a problem with larger blocks.)\n\n> Useful, but I find it strange that you focused on the 50th percentile rather than the 90th percentile.\n\nGood observation.\n\nThe main reason why I used the 50th percentile was that it seemed to correlate extremely well with actual orphan rates for the period for which data was available (actually, it gave expected orphan rates slightly higher than the actual rates). I suppose that the reason for this is that mining nodes would not fall in the 90th or even the 50th percentile, as they probably have better hardware and infrastructure and are more well connected to the network than most non-mining nodes (but, yes, this is more of an informed guess rather than a confirmed fact). For non-mining nodes, block propagation time isn't really relevant to their functioning (unless it's longer than actual block times), so the 90th or the 95th percentile can be disregarded without problem. \n\n(All the data there was before FIBRE btw. The relay network means that all of those number should actually be far higher than in those calculations as it has made orphan rates almost zero.)\n\n> And any consistent measurable advantage for a mining pool basically means that it'll be the only mining pool anyone connects to. \n\nI guess the point being made was that 0.3% was not a significant enough amount to be able to differentiate it from statistical noise. \n\nAlso, previous instances where pools reached close to majority hash power, there was major push back. \n\n> That miner's comments does not at all \"show\" that larger blocksizes would not lead to mining centralization. It simply asserts it. What it does show is that the cost of bandwidth isn't a significant factor in miner profitability. And I'm not sure if anyone's seriously proposed that a miner's personal bandwidth resources was ever a major issue. \n\nThe only way larger blocksizes could affect mining centralization would be if larger blocksizes increased the cost of running a mining operation significantly. \n\nSince almost all of the cost of running a mining operation is consumed by the cost of electricity and mining hardware, and since blocksizes have zero effect on those factors, blocksizes are extremely unlikely to effect mining centralization.\n\nBlock sizes can possibly effect bandwidth and storage costs, and orphan risk. These costs, however, as described by the miner, are negligible and insignificant.\n\n> I see what you're implying with these, but it doesn't get us any closer to figuring out what level of resource is appropriate to foster a decentralized set of miners and full-nodes. \n\nWell, it shows that if observations that have held true for several decades continue to hold true, then we could easily double blocksizes every two years or so without the risk of losing even a single node. Improvements in the client software, and other off-protocol improvements like the relay network means we should be able to do even better.\n\n>  The reason something like a user-activated soft fork works is because if an economic majority (or better yet, supermajority) is using new rules, miners that don't then follow those new rules will no longer be mining the longest chain.\n\nOnly hash power can determine the longest chain, right? \n\nHow do non-mining nodes help determine the longest chain? The longest chain is the one with the most hash power. Non-mining modes do not contribute.\n\nI guess that you meant was the most \"valuable\" chain instead of the \"longest\" chain. Would that be correct? If so, we agree that what matters most is the most valuable chain (because it will eventually become the longest chain). However, value isn't determined by the number of full nodes or even the proportion of nodes per user, it's determined by the market through trading/transacting, which can be done perfectly well without a node (and is, in fact, done more often without such nodes).\n\n(Also, an UASF cannot work. But let's not get into that for now.)\n\n> Only the proportion of full-nodes that are creating transactions matters.\n\nLike I said before, I do agree that nodes that send/receive lots of transactions, or high value of transactions, are somewhat relevant (like nodes run by businesses and exchanges; because they are helpful for determining value) and all other nodes are absolutely irrelevant.\n\nI still don't see how the proportion of full-nodes per user is relevant. (Is it even a measurable quantity?)\n\n> I'm a little flabbergasted here. A 5 user network where all 5 users are equals is literally 100% decentralized - maximum decentralization. It is in fact much harder to build larger decentralized networks but more users does not == more decentralization. I'm pretty confused why you think it would mean that. \n\nOkay, that's pretty easy to explain. :)\n\nFor a network that has only 5 nodes, you have to find a way to disable/compromise only those 5 nodes to destroy the network. If those nodes share the same jurisdictions, or use the same ISP, or are geographically close, the network is even more easy to take out. \n\nHowever, if there are 50 nodes, it would be more difficult to disrupt the network by a factor of 10.\n\nThe more nodes there are and the more decentralized they are geographically and across political boundaries, ISPs etc., the more secure and censorship-resistant the network is.", 2], ["2018-01-02 23:08:42", "That is indeed a good point.

If someone can actually show that planned hard-forks are risky, it would be easier for everyone to agree.

Is there any reason we couldn't change the software so nodes listen by default, and could listen without putting in any effort to open a port? Something like what torrent clients do to allow peers to connect and download from you even without an explicit open port?\n\nThat said, a leecher node may not give back to the network, but it does give its user the ability to validate the blockchain for whenever they get around to sending (or receiving) a transaction. \n\n> I don't see why I should expect to run one for almost free\n\nIts not about expetation but reality. If we want most people to actually run a full node, we need to change the parameters. If we don't care about most people actually running full nodes, then that's different parameters.\n\n> I recognize that running a node adds almost nothing of value to anyone, including myself\n\nJust running a node doesn't add much value, but only accepting transactions that happen on blocks you've validated does add something of value in the case of a chainsplit. At that point, running an SPV node doesn't give you the ability to decide which chain to choose. I think we can get to a point where SPV nodes at least validate the last like day of blocks and can actually participate in the process of choosing which chain to look at in the case of a split. And then maybe this whole argument goes away.\n\n> Latency affects block propagation time, so it's not required to be considered twice\n\nYou don't want to count it twice, but you want to count it separately. As you increase bandwidth, latency doesn't decrease, and so you can't just say 2 times the bandwidth, half the propagation time. Its still more than half the propagation time because the latency doesn't cut in half. \n\n> Why not make it a criteria that it should be possible to run a node on very low-end smartphones on a 2G connection?\n\nThat sounds like reasonable criteria. I would imagine that's similar criteria to what I put forth. \n\n> Do you think it will be preferable over the present situation? If yes, why? And if not, why?\n\nI think it would be ideal if all clients (light or not) had the ability to validate the correct chain in a chainsplit. Right now a full node is required to do this (because there's no other software that's been built to do this yet). \n\n> For non-mining nodes, block propagation time isn't really relevant to their functioning so the 90th or the 95th percentile can be disregarded without problem.\n\nTrue. I'd be curious to know propagation percentiles to miners (including pool miners). I guess I assumed the data was about miners only. Is that not the case? \n\n> Also, previous instances where pools reached close to majority hash power, there was major push back.\n\nThat's good to know. What kind of push back was there?\n\n> The only way larger blocksizes could affect mining centralization would be if larger blocksizes increased the cost of running a mining operation significantly.\n\nCosts or only one side of things. There's actually one other way: if larger blocksizes made the revenue of mining significantly different for different miners. This would happen if propagation times got too high. Imagine if it took 10 minutes to propogate a full block. You'd have the blocks get stuck with one miner for perhaps days until another miner randomly got ultra-lucky and stole the mining process for the next few hundred or thousand blocks. This would really increase centralization drastically.\n\n> then we could easily double blocksizes every two years or so without the risk of losing even a single node. \n\nTheoretically. But remember that commonplace computing is only really like 25 years old. There still plenty of 90s machines still in operation, and as the age of computing gets older, we're going to see more people making due with old hardware (more than in previous decades) because the resources of day-to-day computing needs hasn't increased as fast as hardware progress has. \n\n> Only hash power can determine the longest chain, right? How do non-mining nodes help determine the longest chain?\n\nOnly hash power can determine the longest chain for a *particular* set of consensus rules. But if there's a chainsplit, users will ignore a longer chain if its not valid according to their rules.\n\n> I guess that you meant was the most \"valuable\" chain instead of the \"longest\" chain. Would that be correct?\n\nI suppose when I said \"longest chain\" before, I wasn't being precise enough. Yeah, most valuable chain might be a better way to put it. \n\n> value isn't determined by the number of full nodes or even the proportion of nodes per user, it's determined by the market through trading/transacting, which can be done perfectly well without a node. \n\nTrue, but the receiver of a particular coin has to determine if they've received it, and that does require a node. If the node that receiver is using doesn't think the transaction happened on a valid chain, then they didn't actually receive the coin (its a different coin then they are using). \n\n> I still don't see how the proportion of full-nodes per user is relevant. (Is it even a measurable quantity?)\n\nI'd say the important measurement is % of transaction volume received by users using fully validating nodes. Its almost definitely not feasibly measurable, but I think that's the important quantity. \n\n> Also, an UASF cannot work. But let's not get into that for now.\n\nI think maybe if I explain how I think a user activated fork would work, it'll give you insight into where we disagree. So I tried to think about how a UASF would work, but I couldn't figure it out. I think I can explain how a UAHF would work tho. Imagine a scenario where you have a network of 100 nodes. 10 are miners, and the other 90 are non-mining full nodes. Let's say 80/90 non-mining users want to soft fork, and to keep it simple, let's say that those users do 90% of the network's transaction volume. Even if 100% of the miners don't want that fork and don't do it, one of those 80 users can set up a single mining node that starts mining with new rules and 90% of the transaction volume would then happen with those new rules, forking the chain. The other miners could continue with only 10% of the original transaction volume, but they'd likely switch over to the more valuable chain. This kind of behavior could also be utilized to block MAHFs. Soft forks are another story and I don't have a good grasp on the boundary conditions there.\n\n> If those nodes share the same jurisdictions\n\nSure, if 5/5 nodes are in the same jurisdiction, they're more centralized. But there's lots of types of centralization/decentralization. Jurisdictional diversity is one, ownership diversity is another, locality is another, software implementation diversity is another. But decentralization is different from resilience of the network. I agree a network of 5 is less resiliant than a network of 500, but a network of 5 can be just as decentralized as a network of 500 - tho i would agree that a network of 500 has a potential maximum decentralization greater than a network of 5, just because you can have a wider diversity (1 in each of 500 jurisdictions rather than 1 in each of 5). But while decentralization helps the goal of censorship resistance, they aren't the same thing. \n", 1], ["2018-01-02 23:53:26", "> I think the primary difference between ETH and BTC is that with ETH the development philosophy seems to be lets do everything we can until someone has a good reason to disagree, whereas with BTC it's let's not do anything until we can get almost everyone to agree with something. \n\nOther than a couple of reservations, I can agree with this overall sentiment.\n\nAnd I think that's a strong point in favor of BTC.

Can it be said that without the self-incentivised motives, there is no valuable blockchain?\n\nPretty much hit the nail on the head there. Technically (pedantically) speaking, you can have a blockchain work (at least temporarily) without the proper incentive arrangement set up, but there's no reason to expect it to continue working if that's the case... and if there's no \"reasonable assurance\" that the structure will be available tomorrow (or in a few years), then a semi-rational market should result in a trending-to-zero valuation for the chain (and the asset that powers it) over time.\n\n>Does each and every variation of blockchain become useless when you take economic incentives out?\n\nIt's tough to say, since that's a pretty \"absolute\" claim... but arguably, yes. If you don't want the \"distributed, self-propelled engine\" part (which relies on the economic incentives) then you can use other data structures than a blockchain, which are more suited for whatever purpose or use-case you have in mind. To recommend a particular data structure, you'd have to specify what exactly you're trying to build, but in *most* cases that I've encountered, a solid database component (or a solid end-to-end encrypted messaging layer, or [even more rarely] a BFT limited-access consensus network) is basically \"the right tool for the job\", and trying to \"add a blockchain into the mix\" is actually unnecessarily complicating things (and making them much less efficient in the process).\n\n>If so, why do I hear people talking about using blockchain for supply-chain management or improving transparency in government spending?\n\nIn my opinion, it's a psychological defense mechanism against the initial, early dismissals of Bitcoin that we've seen since 2010ish. People were quick to dismiss Bitcoin as a scam, but as it kept growing despite their skepticism, one of the best (and most \"politically correct\") ways to \"save face\" was to adopt the line: \"Well it's not *Bitcoin* that's really so revolutionary... it's the *blockchain* technology underneath!\" This pretty much resulted in a (mostly subconscious) culture of \"embracing blockchain but rejecting the *money* component\" (since Bitcoin represents \"using a blockchain for money\", after all, and if you embrace that component, then you kind of have to admit you were wrong about Bitcoin all along)... and this results in the (in some cases silly and contrived) \"use cases\" that are repeated so often.\n\n>What incentive mechanism are there to keep the ledger distributed? Will a soft, non-economic incentive such as, \"I want to enforce my government to spend responsibly, therefore I'll spin up the government ledger node/miner\" work?\n\nPossibly, but \"altruistic\" assumptions are much less reliable than \"self-interest\" and \"greed\" are. We know people are greedy, and we can assume this will continue to hold true. Meanwhile, if we're hoping for people to continue supporting projects out of the goodness of their hearts, we have a long list of historical examples where \"tragedies of the commons\" occurred, in which people did exactly the opposite.\n\nWe can't *rule out* the possibility of this working, entirely, of course... but it's just not the strongest of foundations to build from.\n\n>Then I see promising projects like Democracy.Earth who are trying to figure out liquid democracy. Will reputation and social systems like Proof of Identity and Attention Mining as described by their whitepaper work without hard economic motives?\n\nHard to say. Liquid democracy is a fascinating well of potential, but the devil is always in the details.\n\n>if Rootstock runs seamlessly and we are able to port over any Solidity written program and build smart contracts that are 2 way pegged to Bitcoin, I would assume people would build on top of the most secure network. How exactly do offchain smart contracts borrow from Bitcoin's security, if at all?\n\nThe general premise of sidechains (which Rootstock is an example of) is to have the \"sidechain tokens/coins\" pegged to bitcoins as directly (and securely) as possible. If a \"perfect peg\" can be achieved, this means that sidechain-coins and bitcoins can be swapped seamlessly, and any value captured by the sidechain in question would necessarily \"trickle up to Bitcoin\" because now bitcoins can be used to harness the benefits of that sidechain through the peg.\n\nAgain, the devil is in the details, in this case the details concerning that \"peg\" component. The most-seriously-pursued approach is currently the [Drivechain](http://www.drivechain.info/) implementation, but it's a little bit complicated and tricky to wrap your mind around the moving parts properly, and it hasn't been fully built/finalized yet.

A blockchain is just a data structure that can be used in many ways for many things.   Rather that just go with what you hear, I suggest that you actually do your homework, through finding and reading the proper material.\n\n\"Mastering Bitcoin\" by Andreas Antonopoluos is a highly regarded book.   Read the introductory part, where he states that a blockchain is just a distributed ledger.  Then go to the chapter entitled \"The Blockchain\" for a description of that ledger.

Bitcoin works, not only because it incentivizes honesty, but becuase it disincentivizes dishonesty. There has to be something at stake for any potential attacker to lose when they're discovered, just as much as there has to be something to gain for any honest participant. Attackers to the bitcoin blockchain lose the energy spent hashing (assuming a double-spend attack, which is just about the only bad thing an attacker can get away with), while attackers to most  proof-of-stake blockchains stand to lose their staked coins when caught lying. \n\nFor this reason, I don't see pure altruism as a good securing mechanism for any blockchain.

That's based on my memory and [what came up when I googled it](http://dev.lightning.community/lapps/).\n\nNothing too complicated about that.\n\n> What are some theoretical uses?\n\nAFAICT, the main promise of lightning network is to bring the convenience of instant transactions to the Bitcoin network without using a trusted service.  While that might not sound too sexy on the surface, that's actually a really big deal.  If and when we can make Bitcoin as convenient to use as fiat today, that would be pretty huge.  Still a long way to go, but lightning is a big step in the right direction, IMO.\n\nAnother bonus, though, is the addition of micropayments.  This can be useful for a subscription or pay-per-use type of scenario.  These already exist today, but they require you to deposit a certain amount of money first.  Lightning could enable this without requiring the initial deposit.  You could, quite literally, pay-as-you-go.\n\n> Are they smart contracts?\n\nThe words \"smart contracts\" are 99% hype, IMO, so I don't think it really matters.\n\nBut anyway, the technical answer is \"yes\", because lightning channels themselves ARE smart contracts.  A smart contract is, roughly speaking, any sort of redeem script that is more complicated that a simple payment to a single public key.\n\nMultisig is a type of smart contract.  So is CheckSequenceVerify (CSV), which is the most up-to-date form of a timelock used in Bitcoin.  So is using a prehash to lock up a contract.\n\nThe transactions used to open, close, and update lightning channels make use of all three of the above concepts.\n\nLightning is, IMO, the most promising use for smart contracts.\n\n> Are they compatible with with Dapps?\n\nI see no reason why not.

You send them $0.10 and get an ounce of gas. You send $0.1 again and again get an ounce. The worst thing that can happen - assuming stable connection and a well-functioning network - is that the gas station is robbing you by your initial $0.10 which is virtually nothing.\n\nI dont think gas stations will actually use this, but I think this outlines the concept of micro-incremental payment for ultra-trustless purchases of qualified goods.", 3]]}, "169": {"created": "2018-03-02 02:40:57", "title": "Your Monthly \"Ask r/BitcoinDiscussion\" Thread - Got a noob question?

One of the particulars of rolling out a soft fork is determining the time at which the new rules go live, which can be tricky in a decentralized network.\n\nPrior to Segwit, the particular timing of soft forks had be using miner signalling to determine the timing.  This is a Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF).  It wasn't commonly called this at the time, but it's a helpful distinction to make.  How this would work is that after a lot of discussion, public discourse, testing, consensus building, etc, the new code would be sent out to the network.\n\nMiners would then signal in their blocks when they were ready to start validating the new rules.  95% was the threshold initially used at the time, meaning once 95% of blocks over a two-week period were signalling readiness, the softfork would be \"locked-in\", and would activate at the end of the next two-week period.\n\nDue to the blocksize debate and animosity between certain portions of the mining community with other groups, Segwit signalling stalled around 30% for several months.  It's important to understand that miner signalling was never really meant to be a way for miners to decide and vote on proposals, it was just a mechanism to determine timing.  In this case, however, it was being used as a veto.\n\nCertain portions of the Bitcoin community were very upset about this, since they felt as though miners were abusing their position, and were going against the wishes of the broader community.\n\nIn early 2017, support began to form for a User Activated Soft Fork, as an alternative to miner signalling.  There was comparable precedent for this in the past, where soft forks had been rolled out by the community just choosing a \"flag day\" or \"flag block\" where the community just agrees on a certain day or block number and say \"ok, from this day/block, we're going to activate the new rules.\"\n\nThere were several UASF proposals, but the one that garnered the most support was UASF-148, which chose August 1st as a flag day.  Code was written (by a Litecoin dev, interestingly) and the movement started to garner more and more support.  The code wrote that anyone running UASF-148 would simply reject blocks that didn't signal segwit support.\n\nThis was a way for the community to respond to the miners' veto through economic activity.  It's important to understand here that all blocks considered valid by UASF nodes would be considered valid by non-UASF nodes, but vice versa is not true.  This means that if a majority of hashpower ran UASF, only 1 chain would remain.  On the other hand, if a minority did *not* run UASF initially, there would be a chain split.  The goal/hope of UASF in the event of a chain split was to have the UASF chain be more valuable than the non-UASF chain, which would incentivize the miners to switch over.  If the UASF chain ever become longer than the non-UASF chain, it would overwrite and wipeout the non-UASF chain.\n\nThere is a metric shit-ton of game theory and various scenarios that could have played out here, but that's a rabbit hole that we'll step over for the time being.\n\nNow, a contentious and unstable chain split was undesirable for many parties, so a lot of efforts began in order to avoid this.  This included the Segwit2x effort, which had the support of lots of the hashpower.  In response to UASF, they decided to update their own code to force their members to all signal Segwit before the August 1st date in order to avoid a chain split.  Essentially, it was made compatible with UASF-148.  It was a pretty damn messy affair, and barely complete in time, but it worked.  Miner signalling reached 100% by August 1st, and the UASF-148, Segwit2x, and main chain all remained the same chain.\n\nAt this time, the big-blocker anti-segwit crowd deliberately split off to create BCH, but that's a little bit separate.\n\nIt's worth noting, by the way, that pretty much all parties claim responsibility/credit for activating segwit.  Technically, miners eventually all signalled for it.  Segwit2x also coded in the change, so they liked to say they kept the chain together.  I personally think that UASF was the driving force behind it...it seems tenuous to think that it was just a coincidence that everyone else got their shit together just before UASF-148's flag day.\n\nI hope that answers your question.

For Bitcoin this means n-of-n multisig scripts can be stored in constant space, the corresponding signature data can also be stored in constant space, and they can have constant validation time.  This can also be done without storing the original public keys anywhere on the blockchain.  I assume this could bring the space and validation-time requirements of payment channels closer to those of simpler transactions.  \n* For the more general m-of-n multisig, when nCm is small enough, a Merkle tree structure can be used to represent all possible valid aggregated keys.  Proof of inclusion in the tree would be O(log nCm), and only the Merkle root and this proof would have to be part of the witness, so long as the redeemer knows enough about the tree to generate the proof.  Validation would presumably not be bottlenecked by anything new so long as nCm is reasonable.  (It sounds like it could be quite large in practice due to the full Merkle tree not needing to be on-chain.)  I have seen this mentioned more generally before as a way to allow one of many scripts to redeem a P2SH output without revealing what the other possible (sub)scripts are.  \n* There is also a generalization where the signing of n different messages each by n public keys can be aggregated into one signature.  This could allow a scheme where a transaction with multiple inputs could be signed once.  \n\nSome questions I have:\n\n* What is the concrete benefit of the new privacy properties?  When entering a multisig contract, it is already essentially doing coinjoin.  Coinjoin has the privacy weakness that the participants know which keys are which, but this is also true of aggregated 2-of-3 multisig; I believe each participant would know which 2 parties redeemed the coins, since they participated in key aggregation, regardless of whether the public keys are on the blockchain or not.  (Without having gone through all the math, my impression is that privately sharing X_i^a_i instead of X_i could serve to hide X_i, but it would defeat the purpose of introducing a_i and make rogue key attack possible again, so it sounds like everyone has to know {X_i} and compute the aggregated key themselves.)  I can't immediately think of a situation where hiding the original public keys matters, assuming participants are not re-using public keys.  (Although hiding the fact that it is multisig at all is clearly interesting.)\n* How big of an assumption is the hardness of the one-more discrete log problem, compared to the discrete log problem?  (I guess more specifically, are there high-stakes cryptosystems that have been in production for a while, rely on the one-more discrete log problem, and haven't been broken?)\n\nEdits: Lots of BS fixed, but there is probably more", 6], ["2018-01-19 16:01:03", "Please recall that starting last week we now require submission statements for link-type posts.

Of course, they can't be forced on users. They are a bad way of solving any problem that affects the whole network. We need other design solutions. Things like FIBRE, compact blocks, changing block-sizes limits, etc. are solutions that users do not need to be even aware of, they don't need to be \"forced\".

If not using an optional feature causes problems, that is, again, a design-induced problem.\n\n> Youtube operates on the internet, Coinbase operates on Bitcoin, not the other way around.\n\nCoinbase doesn't really operate on Bitcoin. They just offer a custodial wallet and the service of buying/selling Bitcoin in some countries.

And it looks like they are indeed decreasing their reliance on BTC. Just in a different way. They are doing it by offering their services for other coins (ETH, LTC, BCH) while also apparently looking to add even more coins to their portfolio. And their strategy in this regard makes a lot of sense.\n\n> They should use the technology available to make their heavier usage still work on the same network.\n\nCoinbase isn't complaining about the current situation. Not using SegWit and not batching transactions still works just fine for them. They probably decided that doing those things would have no tangible effect on their revenue and so can be put-off for later. This would be a completely rational thing for them to do. They are interested in increased revenue and profits, which is exactly what one should expect from a business like Coinbase - and adding SegWit, etc. probably don't make sense to them from that perspective. \n\nAgain, Coinbase isn't complaining about the current situation. It is the other users of BTC who are complaining about Coinbase, because they want lower fees for themselves.\n\nIt's important to correctly identify the problem here before trying to go about solving the problem. The problem is high transaction fees and users wanting lower fees. The correct way to solve this problem is to (ignore Coinbase, and) make changes to Bitcoin to make it meet user expectations. Coinbase isn't the problem. Like I said before, this isn't a one-time, Coinbase-specific problem, it'll be a recurring problem as long as there are transaction backlogs and high fees (it was \"malicious miners\" before this, Coinbase now... someone else later).\n\nCoinbase here is probably using Bitcoin in the way that makes most sense to them. Since Coinbase have a non-infinite number of engineers, the decision to add SegWit support is probably also a decision to suspend/slow-down work on adding a new coin to Coinbase. It is very likely that the other alternative makes more sense to them. \n\n> By your own logic: why should miners jump through complicated hoops to get Bitcoin to work? If Bitcoin doesn't work with miners just using Bitcoin, it's bad design.\n\nWho is asking miners to jump through complicated hoops though? Making anyone jump through complicated hoops is bad design.

That's what I meant with \"coinbase works on Bitcoin like youtube works on the internet\". Coinbase asking for bigger blocks is like Youtube asking for more bandwidth.

FIBRE, compact blocks, make these solutions more achievable. A major block-size limit increase without FIBRE and compact blocks could have been somewhat problematic.\n\nSharding seems like an interesting idea too, but is a lot more complicated than a simple block-size limit increase.\n\n> By that same logic decreasing the blocksize would be \"good design\" as it would increase fees and make companies upgrade without outside pressure.

If your target users want lower fees, then a small block-size limit is simply terrible design. If users were asking for higher fees, only then it would have been a good solution to that problem. But absolutely no one is asking for higher fees. Again, you have to identify the correct problem in order to solve things.

It's cheaper for them to just offset the cost onto the entire network, but that doesn't mean it's good practice to let them continue doing that. \n\nIf the numbers that are being tossed around are somewhat accurate the fees would drop significantly more and even if it's \"just\" $3, the cheer number of transactions would make that a significant amount in total.\n\nIn defense of Coinbase, I do understand it's a tremendous effort to scale such a fast-growing company and the effort to just keep things running is huge. Great example is Kraken, they do keep up with the technological progress on Bitcoin (I remember a tweet from Kraken when nearly all exchanges suffered from the transaction malleability attack stating something in the lines of: Kraken not affected because: preparation), but yesterday they suffered a 2 day outage.   \nSo I get this is not an easy thing, but that doesn't mean it's fine the way it is and users can't be annoyed by the decisions they've made.", 3], ["2018-01-15 02:14:55", "> I think a good thought-exercise to counter the \"bad solutions\" idea is: what if we found an opt-in solution that would make transactions 1 byte in size and blocks easily verifiable on a phone? Would you think that is a bad solution? What if it was 2 bytes? 3? At which transaction-size do you cross the line from good to bad solution? \n\nIf not using the opt-in feature causes the network to be worse off, then the problem still exists and nothing has really been solved. If all transactions are made 1 byte by *default* though, then it'll probably be very very effective (and would be an example of good design). But if users need to perform multiple actions to get their transactions to be 1 byte instead of 200 bytes, it'll be considerably less effective (and a good designer would not necessarily expect it to solve the problem of high fees).\n\nLike I said, SegWit, Schnorr etc. are themselves *good* as optional features that some users may sometimes use. However, relying on them to solve transaction backlogs or high fees is an unrealistic expectation from a design perspective. \n\nExpecting users to use them all the time and then blaming users for not using them when problems arise is a sign of design failure.\n\n> Let's agree to disagree then. I think just making things bigger is a terrible way of scaling any technology. Every technology there is has had essential progress being made beyond making things bigger.\n\nDepends on what you are talking about, really. \n\nWe've come from 1.44 MB floppy disks to 16 GB pen-drives as standard in only a couple of decades. If we were still trying to fit every digital document into a floppy disk because \"making things bigger is a terrible way of scaling any technology\", I wonder where we would have gotten by now. :P \n\nAnd, really, to me, this is pretty much what the BTC chain is trying to do and it's not working at present.\n\nI do agree with you other point that every technology there is has had essential progress being made beyond making things bigger. That, however, does not mean that making things bigger does not also work.\n\n> Users always want bigger, faster, cheaper. That doesn't mean only catering to those needs is a good solution.\n\nYes, it does. Catering to user needs is the only thing that works. If you don't cater to user needs one way or the other, users will switch to other products (as is happening with Bitcoin) that caters to them.\n\n---\n\nThe only reasonable thing to do here with the situation with Coinbase is, if you are unsatisfied with their services, shift to some other wallet and exchange that provides the same service in a way that you find suitable. Coinbase is processing legitimate transactions and in a permission-less system they are free to do it in any way they like and suits their interests. \n\nMy assessment of the situation, from a design perspective, is that the problem is with the BTC chain and not with Coinbase's actions.", 2], ["2018-01-16 17:31:01", ">That, however, does not mean that making things bigger does not also work\n\nI never said it doesn't also work or that we should never do that, I just think it's bad to have it as only solution.\n\nBigger blocks are like a building full of floppy disks.\n\nThat said, I don't think it's useful to continue discussing this if you think huge blocks are better to lower the fees than 1 byte transactions.

But the heart of your question is about the two-way peg, which is what I meant and I do have a plan for.\n\nI am developing a conservative script replacement that adds enough features to validate an SPV proof from a bitcoin-like chain and use covenants to achieve lock-up periods. I am also implementing the \"proof of proof of work\" skip list commitment structure that allows for the extraction of compact SPV proofs small enough to be contained in a witness and validated in a transaction. So the side chain would be capable of reading and correctly validating a peg-in proof.\n\nI have some experience getting consensus changes into the reference bitcoin software (BIPs 68, 112, and 113 are in bitcoin; working on 98, 116, and 117 now). This script, covenant, and proof-of-proof-of-work stuff is necessarily more complex but the architecture is also designed to be of the sort most likely to be accepted upstream, allowing main chain validation of the return peg and completing the loop. Still, getting these features into bitcoin core could take years (as it should be!). In the mean time it is possible to make use of bitcoin on the side chain as either collateral or credit. There are three different approaches to doing this, all supported:\n\n(1) The same technology that underlies Lightning cross-chain swaps can be used to make side chain transactions dependent on a main chain HTLC or vice versa, allowing 2nd layer solutions to use both chains simultaneously. This lets you use bitcoin (from main chain lightning channels) and side chain issued assets simultaneously in a trustless way, including smart contracts more complex than simple payments. There's actually no need for transferring coins between chains when doing this, although you don't get the benefit of CT/CA blinding the bitcoin values and asset tags.\n\n(2) Because issued (and confidential) assets are supported, you can also make bitcoin IOUs and transact with those for later settlement on the main chain as a form of credit. This is the \"classic\" Ripplepay idea, usually described now as transitive credit or transitive trust transactions. This is used to setup payment channels of IOUs similar in structure to lightning which let you transact on credit with anyone connected on the network by swapping IOUs at each step along the way, but only exposing yourself to the counterparty risk of the nodes you are directly connected to, which unlike lightning would be people or companies or organizations you know and have vetted for credit risk, not random nodes on the network. This isn't trustless and requires some work, but the trust is local on the graph, the risk is quantifiable and opt-in not systemic, and you are rewarded for the risk via higher route-through fees. No matter what routes through you, you are only ever exposed to counterparty risk from the small handful of nodes you explicitly setup channels with, and only to the limits you set. Pro strategies would be to buy crash and/or moonshot options to lessen the volatility risk of trading bitcoin IOUs and work the price of those options into the fee cost of routing through you.\n\n(3) The federated peg is supported, of course, where a coalition of individuals or companies manages the pool of funds. Related enough to be in this grouping, there's the possibility of having an options clearing house (collateralized like LedgerX rather than CBOE) issue tokens redeemable for their contracts on this chain, from which you can construct a synthetic bitcoin. The peg-in/peg-out process would be done by market makers that create or exercise shares of those options on the options clearing house, maintaining the 1:1 peg for as long as the underlying clearing house remains solvent. That's not trustless, but given the responsibilities and oversight over clearing houses it is as close to trustless as you can get within the regulations of the existing financial system. A little bit more speculatively I am also exploring technical approach to a blind signing functionary set which would be another way of achieving a 1:1 peg using federated peg only in this case the strong federation is reused for many different things, potentially reducing the risk to any one project.\n\nSo it's a multi-pronged approach until such time as the necessary features make their way into bitcoin to support the return peg. Bitcoin will be one asset among many though, and the chain will have utility and be secure even while bitcoin support requires jumping through a few hoops.\n\n(Edit: I should mention that (2) and (3) are actually two extremes of a common unified approach. If you are uncomfortable holding bitcoin IOUs or being liable yourself due to price volatility, you can mitigate this as mentioned by buying options to hedge against the downside and passing the cost of those options on into routing fees. Now if you systematically did this for all the IOUs it goes from being credit to collateral and is what's called a synthetic asset. The resulting \"IOU\" is *really* an IOU from the clearing house and 1:1 pegs the value of bitcoin, +/- the cost of arbitrage by a market maker. The interesting point with (2) is that you can have it not be an all-or-nothing proposition, allowing a sliding scale between \"epsilon trust\" synthetic assets using regulated options clearing houses and explicit but minimal trust in peer-to-peer credit.)", 3], ["2017-12-25 14:49:01", ">a conservative script replacement that adds enough features to validate an SPV proof from a bitcoin-like chain\n\nFrom my understanding, the general weakness of this is that bitcoin miners can steal the sidechain coins by creating a fake SPV proof and then censoring any transactions that contest the fake proof.

And yes, a 51% cartel can fake a return proof and take the funds. SPV security goes with being a \"SPV 2-way peg.\"\n\nOne point is that there is a holding period and the users could act to press miners to not process the final claim while the honest network catches up. The safe way to accomplish this would be to run the main chain and side chain daemon side by side with a filter in the main chain that rejects peg claims which don't verify. Generally running consensus code this way is equivalent to an extension block and generally hurts decentralization. But a few proactive users could run these dual-validating nodes and sound the alarm when they see a return peg from a non-public side chain history, rallying a UASF in the time available before the peg-out claim reaches finality. If the miners still go through with it, stealing user funds merely because the SPV nature of the protocol allows them to do so, that would in my mind be more than adequate justification for a proof of work change.\n\n> I see, so covenants are used to enforce the contest period on withdrawals, right? \n\nCorrect\n\n> Do you have any concerns that covenants might be controversial as a soft fork?\n\nYou can structure covenants to have an expiry. One simple way is to disregard the covenant mechanism, whatever it is, if the input's sequence number is set to the maximum relative lock-time (about 1 year). In such a case the covenants can still be useful for enforcing state in the settlement of a complex contract, but no long-lived covenants are possible.\n\nOn the other hand, covenants are considered dangerous pretty much because they are so powerful. There's an argument to be made that bitcoin protocol is meant to enable and empower users not to patronize them. Yes, you can lock coins up in a complex perpetual KYC covenant or something equally uninteresting. You can also burn coins, and from the hard-core decentralist's perspective the result is the same.\n\nI see valid arguments on both sides and I think the jury is still out.\n\n> Maybe not the best example, but if colored coins are created with them, it could potentially cause incentive misalignment.\n\nColored coins are always possible and cannot be eliminated.\n\n> I'm looking forward to MAST, very exciting.\n\nThanks, me too!

I'm not sure how you'd prevent people from disconnecting the two assets though, if the sidechain contract is more restrictive.\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to here? There's no \"sidechain bitcoin\" asset in this scenario. You have a regular lightning bitcoin payment that happens to use an identical HTLC as some other multi-asset protocol on the side chain, such that committing to one outcome on the side chain triggers the lightning payment (because the HTLC becomes known), or vice versa.\n\n> Also very interesting. I never realized how well the Lightning Network lines up with the old Ripplepay idea, since any IOU you receive can only come from people you have a channel open with, and thus trust.\n\nIt's interesting how the two converged, by accident it seems. A lot of very smart people I know didn't understand lightning at all at first, because the initial descriptions and whitepaper weren't very clear and needed a bunch of new functionality. On the other hand it made total sense to me because I'd recently spent a great deal of time thinking about how you'd go about implementing Ripplepay on bitcoin-like systems, and lightning is just the fully collateralized variant of it. What is interesting about lightning, and which I didn't realize before Dryja and Poon, is that making the Ripplepay \"IOUs\" fully collateralized as they do allows entirely untrusted payment channels to be constructed between arbitrary peers, and therefore quite different graph topologies result, along with a very different fee structure. But I digress.\n\n> This seems like a pretty straightforward and useful layer two to me (opt-in centralization). I'm surprised nobody has done it yet, I guess regulatory compliance is the main issue?\n\nRegulated clearing houses able to make such contract haven't existed until a few weeks ago, so it hasn't been possible until very, very recently. There's still not enough liquidity to do it now, and a company like LedgerX would have to enable the transfer and redistribution of contract shares on some sort of asset issuing platform, be it colored coins or confidential assets. But that's no longer as inconceivable as it would have been a year ago.\n\n> What is being blinded here?

There is an increased risk, but user action can be taken to protect against it.\n\n>You can also burn coins, and from the hard-core decentralist's perspective the result is the same.\n\nYeah, I think that is a strong argument.

I know this is counterintuitive, but think about it:\n\nIf people are still competing for space, who will be willing to pay more: someone who is sending a one-time transaction?  Or someone who will get to open a channel that they can use dozens or hundreds of times over?  Probably the latter case.

Because if we grow at the expense of censorship-resistance, then it isn't really a problem.\n\nNow, you can argue that bigger blocks won't have enough of a negative effect on censorship-resistance to care enough about it, and then we could have that discussion.\n\nBut saying \"Bitcoin must grow\", and act as though that's all that matters doesn't really make much sense, IMO.  I think the statement should be \"Bitcoin must grow without sacrificing censorship-resistance\".  It would be much easier to have a constructive conservation from there.\n\nNow, I can't speak for everyone else, but I certainly am not basing my opinion on any hope of Lightning Network working.

Your concerns about centralization are a red herring because decentralization is not a value in itself. Decentralization serves censorship resistance. Therefore if your transactions are not being censored bitcoin is decentralized enough. There will always be a miner around to push through a transaction. There is zero *empirical* evidence to suggest that censorship is anywhere close to being a problem. Furthermore the new Stash wallet now enables anonymous on-chain transactions making censorship even less of a problem. So to repeat, Core is trying to solve problems they have created for themselves. \n\nIn contrast LN is not truly P2P so you should be concerned more about censorship with Core. Whether they centralize into hubs or not (and they will because capital is not free), LN channels will fall under FinCen's money transmitter laws because they are intermediaries by definition (obliged to pass value from one party to another).

They don't have a silicon chip fab where they make their own designs - these have long since been outsourced to the big fabricators: TSMC (who make Bitmain's chips), Globalfoundries, Towerjazz, UMC, SMIC, Samsung, Intel\n\nThese companies are already centralized and together produce close to 100% of the chips used in modern electronics. \n\nThere is no such thing as an ASIC-proof algorithm. Certain algorithms use a lot of memory and memory is expensive, but you could design a circuit capable of hashing ethash, or cryptonight, or whatever PoW.\n\nSo what does an ASIC-friendly algorithm look like? It means that the chip is based on a relatively open design, and is cheap enough that you could mass produce them in the older foundries. (No need for 7nm designs, for example.) \n\nThe problem is that chip design is hard, and its almost always protected by IP.

First it's a problem best solved with massive scale-once you've designed it each additional wafer isn't that expensive-so immediately from a cost perspective large players still hold an advantage. And the second is that it's still a problem where profitability is based heavily not on the cost of chips but on how power efficient they are.  And on this metric the existing players who are better at making an efficient chip may succeed not only because they're good at designing efficient chips but because they have existing relationships with fabs and the volume needed to get first access to new nodes/shrinks that improve efficiency and speed.\n\nLong story short pretty much any PoW change would just result in the same players once again centralizing mining.

(This might also reduce concerns about bigger blocks giving some miners an edge in income - it might not be economically fair, but it would not represent the security risk it does now.)\n\nIn addition to discarding progress on SHA256 optimization, changing PoW might set a precedent which discourages ASIC designers from trying to innovate in the future.  Whether or not Bitmain's behavior is 100% productive in the short term, they are also working to advance technology closer to the point where every electric heater mines bitcoins, which according to the premise is good for decentralization in the long term.  As I understand it the reason governments issue patents in the first place is as a necessary evil because the cost to society of several years of monopoly is judged less than the benefit of encouraging private innovation.\n\n(Subjectively, I think it's pretty antisocial to try to delete Bitmain for being too good at the game, because inevitably anyone who is playing to win is going to do what they are doing.  If it comes to that, maybe Bitcoin's security model just isn't that good, and it should be left to die a gradual, natural death.)\n\nAlso, changing PoW could lead to a period of even worse mining centralization at first if the developers are paid off by an ASIC designer to gain advance knowledge of the algorithm.", 2], ["2017-11-17 14:53:24", "Related - a way to change PoW gradually via a soft fork: https://github.com/devrandom/btc-papers/blob/master/aux-pow.md .

To begin with, I'm pretty sure that blocks were a tiny fraction of this size back when the network started, so the limit was effectively meaningless with such low traffic.  A naive reading of your post might make someone ignorant of the network's history think that blocks actually *were* regularly 1MB in size back in those early days.\n\n> Even the LN whitepaper states that blocks must be 100MB++ to have an effective LN (otherwise, block-filling attacks would be feasible with small blocks, large number of LN channels).\n\nA *lot* has changed since the LN paper came out.

Of course there needs to be a balance between block space (or cost to transact) and cost to run a node. It's not a black-and-white choice, it's about finding equilibrium. That's why it's important to not rush into what might seem like a simple solution, and instead to think long term. Bitcoin is working towards making the current block size stretch as far as possible before increasing it. This keeps node costs down.\n\n>When the transaction fee costs $1-2\n\nTransaction fees are nowhere near that high, and there are already plenty of plans to ensure they stay low (e.g. lightning network).\n\nIt's not about block size vs other scaling - it's about making bitcoin available to everyone and successful as digital money. This requires a multi-pronged approach to scaling that should keep an eye on the long term.\n\n>A [bcash] full node (with full blocks) can be ran on an average PC, there are many demonstrations of this.\n\n 'Average PC' has nothing to do with the cost or availability of bandwidth. And when has a bcash block ever been full? Typical size of the blocks is ~150KB. Full 8MB blocks would require many times more bandwidth than full 1MB blocks, obviously.\n\nIf ~200GB is required to run a node with 1MB blocks, it would probably take ~1GB or more for 8MB blocks (very rough guess, I don't know it it would scale that linearly). In my country bandwidth cost generally goes up quite steeply after 500GB of data per month.\n\n>So let's increase blocksize!

This is a moot point. You can't spread millions (or billions) of bits of data around the world without using bandwidth.

The network includes both miners and full nodes (otherwise known as validating nodes). Miners, in Bitcoin, do the work. They hash away and give Bitcoin the feature of being immutable. Most miners are also running full nodes. If you wish to change something in a block that happened 3 blocks ago, you would have to redo all of the work since that block, making it economically impossible and therefor assuring immutability. \n\nThen you have the nodes. Nodes are merely people running software (often a wallet) that also validates new transactions and blocks that are being propagated through the network. They independently validate all information on the network and if one of the nodes they are connected to relays faulty information, as in: incompatible with the current protocol, it bans that node for a certain amount of time, or permanently. So people trying to slip in 'fake' transactions or blocks are quickly isolated by other nodes on the network. Because that information is simply not recognized by its peer nodes as valid.\n\nIf a miner decides to change things up and mine a block of a different size, it could, but once propagated to the network, it would be marked invalid and orphaned. Same for a node trying to make a transaction with already spent Bitcoins or some other funky stuff. It would simply not enter the blockchain or mempool as it does not comply with the protocol.\n\nSo what if we want to make a change to the protocol? Sometimes it is needed in case of a bug fix for example. Sometimes it is wanted, like new code allowing for certain functionality. Sometimes it is wanted by some but not by all, like a blocksize increase. The reasons for this might be ideological, economical or political. But let's not get into that right now. If we want to change something, everyone needs to agree to the changes, and on a technical level this means, enforcing the updated protocol. The whole network needs to agree to those new rules. Bitcoin is Bitcoin because the nodes on the network say it is Bitcoin. You want to change something, you are free to do so, but you're version of it will not be compatible with what everyone else is calling Bitcoin. If many people in the ecosystem however agree to a change in the protocol, while another group doesnt, you get a fork. This is what happened with Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin exists to come to consensus, hard forks redefine it. It requires human communication, which is inherently a slow process.\n\n- The hard fork has to get consensus from a technical perspective. Consensus from a non-technical perspective is impossible: what do you say to someone who dislikes the fork for religious reasons?\n\n- For technical consensus, the IETF [rough consensus](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282) model fits well. All valid technical objections to a proposal must reasonably be resolved before moving forward.\n\n- Rough consensus is observable and verifiable by everyone (but does require extensive technical knowledge). This fits well with the \"don't trust, verify\" mantra of Bitcoin.\n\n- For a soft fork rough consensus is pretty straightforward: if the fork does not take away any existing features, and the new features are not harmful, then it will achieve technical consensus.\n\n- For a hard fork you are burdening users with redefining consensus, so it starts off with a cost. The hard fork needs to be overwhelmingly worth it, in order to make up for that cost.\n\n- Assuming there is no loss of functionality, no danger in the new features, overwhelming reasons to make the switch, AND sufficient time has passed to communicate all this information to users, perhaps then we're ready to hard fork.", 3], ["2017-12-16 03:56:23", "And that's the big problem with proposing any change that results in a hard fork. Without a very wide consensus among miners, wallets, exchanges, and users, you'll end up with a split chain. At this point I can't imagine that any Bitcoin hard fork proposal would get wide enough acceptance to avoid a split. There will always be a set of holdouts for the \"original\" chain. I'm just glad I got in early enough to hold tokens on all of the recent splits, even if they're currently worthless. You never know when one of them might actually take off and take over.", 1], ["2017-12-15 19:33:23", "> But what I am wondering is how is this consensus measured? Is it determined by people running nodes? Miners? Developers? Users?\n\nProof-of-Work.\n\nBitcoin is a Proof-of-Work based currency. Consensus in Bitcoin is measured by Proof-of-Work. \n\nFrom the whitepaper:\n\n> The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially   one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested\nin it.\n\nAs of now, decision-making in Bitcoin still works exactly as described in the whitepaper. It would need a hard-fork to change the decision-making process, and that has not been done yet.\n\nIt must also be noted that Proof-of-Work was designed to follow a profit incentive. While someone controlling >51% PoW has the ability to make arbitrary decisions to change the Bitcoin protocol, they will always find it more profitable to follow market-forces.\n\n----\nPersonal opinion:\n\n*Consensus* has often been used as more of a red-herring, being used to stall on and block some proposed improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. \n\nA requirement for 95%+ consensus makes it extremely easy for a malicious actor to veto every proposed improvement to the protocol, and that is undesirable.

For today, it's ok if you simplify this to \"a new type of transaction\".  In order to use it, there needed to be some new rules added to the network, which required a soft fork.\n\nThere are different ways to deploy a soft fork upgrade to the network, and one of those ways is through miner activation by voting in blocks.  From November 2016 - July 2017, this was happening.  All this meant was that miners would set a bit in their blocks indicating that they supported the segwit update.  Once 95% of blocks over a two week period were signalling support, then segwit was ready to go live on the network.\n\nThis happened over the summer.\n\nBecause segwit is now live, there is no need to miners to signal for it any more.

How does that not break with the older clients? A segwit transaction has as you said the signature separated. Therefore an old client just sees the transaction without the signature at all. Since the data without the signature has a weight of 4 its real size is always smaller than 1 MB (excluding the signatures). On the other hand a segwit aware client sees all the separated signatures but it does not matter that the block is larger than 1 MB since the new rule is that it must have at most 4 Mega weight.\n\nTo the second part of your comment: Since the non-signature part of a transaction has weight 4 and only the signature part has weight 1 it would only be possible to have a 4MB block if it only contains signatures (which is clearly not possible).

So, turn off your SPV client for a day*, go find out what the first 2X block looks like, and then store headers for 2 different chains (sorted by whether or not they include that block) and check incoming data against that.

I didn't think much about this originally because it basically means bitcoin has failed,\n but I guess bitcoin businesses don't necessarily absorb as much cost of bitcoin dying if they run a fullnode and always instantly exchange all their bitcoin income.  Either way, this seems like a very specific scenario.\n\nThere are also chain splits as a result of bugs in fullnode software.

But again it comes down to trusting your sources.\n\n> There are also chain splits as a result of bugs in fullnode software. But obviously running said fullnode does not protect you from that.\n\nIt depends on the type of chain split.  If there is a split that, according to your own full node, has two different chains with valid blocks, then you are correct, a full node would have just as much trouble.\n\nThere have been instances where a full node would protect you where an SPV client would not.  For example, in July of 2015, there was a forking event because of SPV mining that involved a chain that had some invalid blocks.  Full nodes would have recognized and rejected these immediately.  However, an SPV client has no ability to determine validity of a block.  At that time SPV clients were at risk of double spend attacks *even if they waited for 6 confirmations*.\n\n> In any case, fork drama seems fundamentally different to me than security under normal operation (even if you consider 2X an attack).\n\nWell, yes.  If everything functions as it should, you're less likely to have problems.

We can't expect Satoshi to have predicted everything.\n\nThe way that this question is worded seems to imply that there IS an amazing way to scale without drawbacks, and Satoshi just didn't see or choose it.  This seems like a very faulty assumption.  There are various methods of scaling, but they all have their drawbacks.  To use the most cited example, we could just increase the block size whenever blocks fill up, but it would come with serious costs to decentralization.\n\nI think everyone can agree that Bitcoin was not perfect in its original form.  There were several minor flaws in the original whitepaper itself (~~I can't find my source at the moment, but if anyone is interested, I'll dig it up~~ [found it](http://www.coindesk.com/nobody-understands-bitcoin-thats-ok/)), and the original code had a LOT of bugs.\n\nThat being said, I'm sure Satoshi was aware that stuff would need to change for the network to grow.  As early as 2010, Hal Finney (one of the earliest cypherpunks and the first person to receive a transaction from Satoshi) [was aware of the scalability issue, and how second layers might be necessary to manage scaling](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211).\n\nAnother thing that I think is worth pointing out is that it *has* scaled well.  Like, really well.  A decentralized network that has scaled to handle ~~seven~~ three transactions a second (with no limitation for borders and distance) for 6.5million users is an amazing accomplishment.  So let's not forget that.\n\nAs for moving forward, I am sure that Satoshi and the other earlier cypherpunks were aware that scaling would be an issue.

Where do we draw the line? And would that change over time, as bandwidth/storage tech improved? And how do we even quantify decentralization?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThought experiment: If Bitcoin grew so large and important that every economic actor with over $1bn in yearly revenue ran a full node, that'd still be thousands of companies, spread around the world (mostly in the countries with the largest economies, of course). Add in a hundreds or thousands governmental nodes, and finally tens or hundreds of nodes from reputable NGOs and non-profits (e.g. funded by some of the large number of private Bitcoin billionaires there would be).\n\nDo you think it'd be possible to get a majority of these nodes to conspire together to censor or double-spend transactions? I doubt it. With a lot fewer actors, we can't even agree on how to proceed with, or even whether to start, enacting legally binding climate treaties (to save or \"save\" the world, depending on your stance).\n\nMy point is: If you go the ad absurdum route of arguing against on-chain scaling on the basis of \"what if every single tx was recorded on Bitcoin's blockchain\" (which won't happen at least until we're ready to abandon nation states, btw), you at least have to consider how *other* aspects of decentralization (like a dramatically increased number of actors depending on it) would play out.\n\n> That cost has to be born by someone.\n\nYes, it would be divided among everyone.\n\n> It seems minimal, but it's actually just not as obvious because it's spread out across thousands and thousands of users.\n\nIt is minimal when you divide it among the actors involved. Clearly, handling 1 MB additional data every ~10 minutes isn't a huge ask for current tech.\n\nI'd turn your statement on its head: 6500 MB per block may seem like a lot, but it's actually not *because it's spread out across thousands and thousands of users*.", 1], ["2017-04-17 00:24:35", "> I found this [gist](https://gist.github.com/harding/dabea3d83c695e6b937bf090eddf2bb3), which was linked from your article, to be the best (concise) summary of the \"errors\" in the white paper.\n\nAgreed, I probably should have just linked that instead.

The interesting question is how we proceed after realizing that it isn't (practically) possible.

To me, EC is just a name for how consensus in any group works - we debate, we signal, we code and eventually we may gain consensus on something. Voila, consensus has *emerged* - from a messy social/economic/political/psychological process.\n\nIt's basically just a way of acknowledging that activation decisions are ultimately made by human beings, not code. Whether the choice happens through what kind of software we run or it happens through setting options inside that software is not important to me. UASF activation would be through EC, for example (but probably won't happen, now that nullc has spoken against it - which is also a part of the [non-]emergence process, btw).\n\nIf you're talking about \"BU's implementation of EC for block size increases\" (a much shallower scope, but which seems is the only way many people frame EC), I think it's lacking in many regards.\n\nExample 1: EC should be all about signalling your intentions for the world to see, but BU doesn't allow you to say what block size you'd *like* to see, it only announces what you'd *currently* accept (through EB/AD parameters).\n\nExample 2: BU hasn't coded up a process for doing the actual upgrade/transition after some meatspace EC is found, which leaves it to blog posts like [these](https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/miner-guide-how-to-safely-hard-fork-to-bitcoin-unlimited-8ac1570dc1a8), which actually describes a really unsafe upgrade process.\n\n...and there's probably other BU-blocksize-EC-problems I didn't think of off the top of my head.\n\nI'm running Core 0.14 myself, at least for now, but I'm not a strong supporter of Core.\n\nI do not agree with the entrenched HF skepticism and I think that the \"HFs are too risky\" proposition have become a self-fulfilling prophesy through the way the community has handled it.\n\nI do not think the base-data block size should have stuck at 1 MB in face of full blocks.

SFs for new rules (plain restrictions) is fine, but I'm more skeptical about hacking new functionality (like a new tx format or defining a new opcode) into something that *looks* like it's understandable to old nodes, but really isn't.\n\nAnyway, that it's a SF is not a *blocker* for me.\n\nI do wish that I had more unbiased information, though. For example, some Core devs are very good at highlighting the benefits of segwit and [the deficiencies of FT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/57xi7c/who_is_the_man_behind_bitcoin_classic_tom_zander/d8wpqj6/), while Classic dev(s?) are [good at the opposite](https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/Flexible%20Transactions.html). But from the way they talk, and the way the community has developed, it's clear that neither side will be able to avoid their own biases.\n\nSeeing as segwit is a one-way road which not only means accepting segwit, but also excludes other options, I'd really like to see a sound neutral comparison of both. So... I don't feel I have the full picture today (and probably never will), and have mixed feelings about that.\n\nWith that said, at this stage I'd gladly accept segwit just to have some progress.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Even though I don't agree with them, I can at least sympathize with a lot of the grievances against certain members of core and the management of the bitcoin fora.\n\nYeah, that's a can of worms and probably best left to other forums.

And I do feel the incumbents have more responsibility for the situation, seeing as they have the de facto leadership positions (in the communication and development spheres) and their stance towards other initiatives hasn't exactly been... welcoming.\n\nThat said, we can't expect everyone's personalities to be perfect, everyone have the right to express themselves as they like, there's no *actual* leadership in a loose open-source community, etc. I get and accept all that, but I wish that they were better at building communities.\n\nAt this point, I'd like to quote from [Confessions of a Necromancer](https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/confessions-of-a-necromancer/content/chapter1.html):\n\n> I've come to think that the very notion of individual intelligence is a dangerously simplified myth.\n\n> It took me decades to realize that technology is a slave to personality. It doesn't matter how good the design, when there are unresolved problems in the organization.\n\n> And so gradually I shifted from technical architect to social architect. From caring about technical designs to caring about people and the psychology that drives them. Because in the end, this is what seems to make the difference between a working project and a failure.\n\n\\- Pieter Hintjens\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> But I have a really hard time grasping staunch opposition to segwit without having to assume spite (or ulterior motives, as asicboost might turn out to be).\n\nI don't, but that's probably because I'm not thrilled about it myself. There's too many unanswered questions, and it's not like that aren't other for-profit companies with possible conflicts of interest as well. Hard for outsiders to judge, but I'm pretty sure it's not as clear-cut as \"Bitmain+Ver are evil, Blockstream are heroes\", which seems to be the narrative nowadays.\n\nAsicboost as a motive for not signalling for segwit seems to be a red herring and the confusion is explained by Jimmy Song [here](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/mining-profitability-and-asicboost-ffdb779ef6dd), and by former mining CEOs of [Spondoolies](https://medium.com/@vcorem/the-real-savings-from-asicboost-to-bitmaintech-ff265c2d305b) and [KNC](https://medium.com/hacker-daily/asicboost-655a73d48ae4). Time will tell, I guess (I hope).\n\nSo far, I chose to think that they're not all involved in some great conspiracy against segwit, or Bitcoin for that matter, and I chose to be skeptical those who jump to conclusions with regards to the motivations of others (especially when they have something to gain from painting others in a bad light)... that goes for both sides, btw.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> I'm curious...you have stated that you run a 0.14 node, but I am getting the sense you are not signalling segwit support. If I've guessed correctly, what's stopping you?\n\nNot being a miner is stopping me, innit? As a simple Bitcoin user (speculator? :P), I have the privilege of watching the fireworks without having to put my money where my thoughts are. I'll hodl and have coins on all chains, regardless of who the winner is. ;)\n\nOr if you're talking about UASF, that's been a silly suggestion from the start if you ask me. I don't much believe in minority forks, regardless of whether ETC has survived or not, and I foresee lots of problems for Bitcoin if a split actually happens (yet some part of me says \"go ahead\" just to get out of the stalemate... go figure).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk, your time to answer some questions: Seeing as you didn't follow up on my EC answer, what's your thoughts about EC in general (the idea of the users/community deciding), and about BU-blocksize-EC in particular? Are you opposed to EC in general (and I don't even see how that's possible, given my definition above) or just BU's stance on how block size should be determined?\n\nAlso, I have a really hard time grasping staunch opposition to reasonable base-data block size increases, e.g. the SegWit+2MB compromise. I am getting the sense that you think that the segwit SF should be activated before considering any HFs - is that correct? :)", 1], ["2017-04-17 02:03:18", "Yeah, we seem to be off to a good start...but the real question is...can it scale well?  ;)", 2], ["2017-04-20 23:26:46", "Hi there, finally got a chance to read through your links a bit more to give you a decent answer.\n\nRe: advantages and deficiencies of segwit and FT, what it come down to for me is that every single criticism I've seen of segwit has either been addressed, or turned out to be overblown/false, or it boils down to more general fears that basically warrant more testing (which seem to be yours concerns as far as I understand them).  Considering that they've tested the shit out of it for more than a year now, and hopefully we'll get another test environment in a real economy in Litecoin soon, there's not much more someone could ask for in terms of an upgrade.\n\nAs for FT, I haven't seen their criticisms addressed.  If there is a resource that could respond to Greg's breakdown that you linked, I'd be eager to read it.  As it stands, the number one red flag for me is:\n\n> On testnet it spontaneously catches fire and rejects the chain, its author doesn't even seem interested in investigating why.\n\nThat seems like a deal-breaker for me.\n\nRegarding asicboost, I took a look through your 3 links.  The third article (by Sam Cole), as I understand it, is demonstrably false, since it claims it would make no economic sense to build asics with hidden asicboost functionality, and Jihan Wu has already declared (admitted?) that their miners have it, but that they just choose not to use it.\n\nThe first two seem to agree that the problem exists, but cite less severe numbers.  So, I don't find myself wholly reassured after reading them (though, I certainly hope the advantage is less than the 30% originally claimed..I've heard it's more like 20% in practice).\n\n> So far, I chose to think that they're not all involved in some great conspiracy against segwit, or Bitcoin for that matter, and I chose to be skeptical those who jump to conclusions with regards to the motivations of others (especially when they have something to gain from painting others in a bad light)... that goes for both sides, btw.\n\nYeah, I don't think there's a conspiracy here either.  I wouldn't go so far as to call Jihan Wu evil, either.  He's just acting in his self-interests.  He has an economic advantage that he'd have to give up if segwit rolled out, and BU is a useful tool to block it.  Seems more likely that he's cashing in on it (wouldn't you?) for as long as he can.\n\nI find it much less likely that it's (as he claims):\n\n> \"something we would not do for the good of bitcoin\".\n\n------------------------------\n\nAs you say, my turn to answer some questions:\n\nNo, I'm not gearing up for UASF.  I'm pretty agnostic about it at the moment, leaning towards no...it's too soon, too fast.  Its current form seems rushed and an emotional response.  Perhaps it could be done correctly further on in the future if necessary, but not now.\n\n> Seeing as you didn't follow up on my EC answer, what's your thoughts about EC in general (the idea of the users/community deciding), \n\nEC as you defined it, already exists (I think we agree on this, right?).  If someone doesn't like the current blocksize cap, they don't have to run core...they can run an alternative client, so the options are there.\n\n> and about BU-blocksize-EC in particular?\n\nBU seems like a rather shoddy piece of work to me.  It has been shown to be bug-ridden in recent months, and sorely lacking in the code review department.  And though it doesn't affect consensus code, the fact that they plant insults and take potshots at their perceived opponents *inside their code* speaks volumes, IMO.\n\nAs for how they suggest reaching blocksize consensus, there doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to stop the network from constantly splitting into chains of different sizes.  The only response I've seen to this seems to be that \"miners won't want that to happen, so they will reach consensus\" but doesn't explain *how*.  It requires a huge leap of faith.  How will they decide?  Would that require cooperation and collaboration from (almost) all the miners?  Isn't that what we want to avoid?\n\n> Also, I have a really hard time grasping staunch opposition to reasonable base-data block size increases, e.g. the SegWit+2MB compromise.\n\nAs I understand it, segwit effectively **is** a 2MB increase.  You probably already know the newly proposed blockweight formula, but just in case:\n\n(nonwitnessdata * 3) + witnessdata <= 4MB\n\nSo, the theoretical limit would be 4MB, but in practice it would more likely settle around 2MB.  Also, it is my understanding that it is designed this way to help clean up the UTXO set, *and as a compromise for those who wanted more on-chain capacity*.\n\nNow, when I hear segwit **and** a 2MB proposed, I think...hey, isn't the compromise already included?  What am I missing here?  It seems like goalpost moving to me.  But even putting that aside...what would the new proposal be?  Presumably, it would be a blockweight calculated like this:\n\n(nonwitnessdata * 3) + witnessdata <= 8MB\n\nSo, an 8MB theoretical limit, but in practice, we'd be seeing 4MB blocks.  Is that what we're proposing?\n\n> I am getting the sense that you think that the segwit SF should be activated before considering any HFs - is that correct? :)\n\nThat is correct.  Why risk a hardfork and chain split when we can have the effective blocksize increase without it?

Secondly, both BTC and BCH mining were very profitable so BTC mining was not altruistic, rather \"not completely optimal\".

Market forces will make it inevitable. \n\n> Altruistic mining probably can't be neglected.\n\nI agree with PVmining, the bcash scenario doesn't really show much about altruistic mining. And one would expect altruistic mining to be less prominent as time goes on and more investment is needed to mine. \n\n> Whether you take into account both fixed and running costs, or whether you only take into account running costs\n\nThis is an interesting point.

So this doesn't really change anything except to be more specific about what costs are important for the attacker to increase. \n\n> To do that, the attacker would need to undercut the running costs for all others\n\nNot true. There is no such thing as \"undercutting\" in mining, just like there's no such thing as \"overcharging\" for transaction fees. As long as the difficulty doesn't change, the profitability of a given amount of hashpower doesn't change. For a given level of difficulty, 100 times as much hashpower means 100 times as many blocks. Theoretically, the attacker could double the hashpower and therefore double the rate of block mining. This would lower fees, but this would only hasten the other miners quitting/redirecting their mining operations. The attacker must only be willing to lose as much money as the rest of the honest miners in total.\n\n> Is this problem applicable to \"pure POS based on deposits\"?\n\nTheoretically yes. For PoS systems where you have to lock up funds for a time, there is some cost associated with not having access to them that would drive the profitability of staking.

At very least the amount of bits will need to be increased. It seems like the consensus is that the hash algorithm doesn't need to be changed now, but I do hear people talk about changing it every once in a while (like when you hear about something nefarious about one of the companies mining bitcoin). \n\n2) I feel like when it needs to change, it will. Switching them out shouldn't be difficult.\n\n3) I think the general consensus is that 10-minute block times are overly conservative. I think 2 minute block times are considered pretty safe (ie not causing too many orphaned blocks). Greg Maxwell recently gave a [talk about block propagation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIuuKCm53o) and mentioned that the effects of latency should be handled with care and a conservative approach is best because its very difficult to measure the effects of propagation latency. Even so, I wouldn't expect too much push back about cutting the blocktime in half. Its not super important tho, just a convenience. The LN will be so much faster that the speed of blocks on the blockchain won't really be very important.\n\nI'd actually like to see bitcoin add **multiple** hash algorithms for mining where a miner can use any one algorithm to mine a block. It seems Myriadcoin is one that does this. That could potentially make mining less centralized as its likely that any individual mining company would focus on one algorithm. Not only that, but it would make it much easier for Bitcoin to recover if a vulnerability was found in one of the algorithms - you could simply switch it off without bringing the system to a halt. You could also then switch in new algorithms in slowly and deprecate old ones. \n\nAlso, I wrote a proposal for a consensus protocol that incorporates Proof-of-Stake alongside Proof-of-Work. If we could use a hybrid protocol like this, we could potentially keep on-chain fees much lower without sacrificing security. https://github.com/fresheneesz/proofOfTimeOwnership", 2], ["2018-02-16 18:24:20", "(1) I wouldn't say it'll never be changed, but I would definitely agree it does not need to be changed now. I think ASIC exclusivity (coin can only be mined efficiently using hardware that has no other use) is very good for security - if a coin can be mined with CPU or GPU, there is a huge amount of hash power which *might* decide to mine on one chain or another. The owner(s) of this hash power currently holds no coins (is not motivated to maintain its value) and has other use for the hardware (so using it to attack the chain is not detrimental to his long-term profitability/utility).\n\nAs for centralization of mining equipment - I think it *is* a problem now, but one I hope will fix itself with market forces. As more people and companies want to mine, more sources of mining equipment will arise, and some of them will sell the ASICs immediately after manufacturing (instead of running it themselves for a few months before shipping them out :))\n\n(2) The current difficulty is finding a hash that starts with ~72 0s (in binary), out of 256 bits of hash. To grow another 72 bits requires the hash power to grow by a zeta factor (a thousand billion billion), and there'd still be a stupendously large number of possible solutions for each block, so mining will still be possible. We will reach the Singularity before the hash algorithm is an issue. I've heard quantum computers can cut the number of bits in half (find a collision for N bits in 2^(N/2) attempts), so once we reach a million billion times more quantum computing power than we currently have ASIC computing power, the difficulty will not be able to increase and the hash function will have to be changed. Note that before that, the signing algorithm will definitely have to be changed as a large-scale quantum computer defeats it too easily\n\n\n(3) I'm sure that, with time, block size will have to grow - f.e. the [LN presentation](http://lightning.network/lightning-network.pdf) says 7 billion people will require a 133MB block, but that is a very rough estimate. Probably any L2 solution (LN or sidechains) will still require the blocksize to increase at some point. I'd like to see the chainstate (set of UTXOs) committed to the blockchain every now and then - that'll allow new nodes to sync only the tail of the chain. However that will severely hurt the blockchain's function as storage - anything stored in the chain long-term will have to be spendable and thus cost more than just a tx fee. That function has, in theory, always been under threat - no one needs to run a non-pruning node, it is done altruistically. There will probably always be some archival nodes, much like the wayback machine. A similar effect can be achieved outside the blockchain, by downloading a pruning-node state from a trusted source. I imagine that one will eventually pop up, and people will start running scripts which check it against the real chain.", 2], ["2018-02-18 16:36:18", "1) Does not need to be changed now, and should only be changed if *strongly* compelling reasons arise to do so.\n\n2) Nothing lasts forever, but it's good enough for now.\n\n3) Sure, any and all.

The theory is that the network is secure because it would take a large investment to gain a lot of hash power and attack the network. But large GPU investments already exist.\n\nBy a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation, at a cost of 0.03$ per GFLOPhour, if the network burns 500,000$ an hour, it has a power of 16 exaflops. China's Sunway TaihuLight is ~100TFLOPS, and Los Alamos' are ~50. I think the secret supercomputers used to crack passwords do not advertise on the TOP500 list.\n\nSo the network will be much bigger than the big governments' computers (it is safe to assume the truly gigantic distributed systems using BOINC will never attack a cryptocurrency network). Getting there might be a bit rocky.\n\n>I wouldn't see an attack so much as a slow domination a centralized market maker (ie, if nicehash was 100x bigger).

But for a pool to do this is very expensive - either they hand out less rewards which causes miners to leave, or they have to pay the lost rewards out-of-pocket which makes them buying the pool's power for the duration of the attack. And would miners stay in a pool that used them to attack another coin?\n\n>I don't think we need bigger blocks as much as more frequent blocks. But that may be because I don't know enough about 0-conf transactions.\n\nBigger blocks and faster blocks are very similar. More frequent blocks lead to more propagation problems than bigger blocks - higher chance for a block to be orphaned increases the advantage for big miners. A bigger block doesn't necessarily take longer to propagate, with network improvements (weak blocks, compact blocks - note BIP-152 is implemented) and is easier to enable.\n\nAs for 0-conf or low-conf, I think that for many transactions a single confirmation is plenty. More frequent blocks would allow the required (low) level of security much faster (say, 2 confirmations of a 1-minute block might be plenty for many uses). A single confirmation is always kind of risky, since the attacker might also post a conflicting transaction and a block might be orphaned randomly.

Weak blocks is when you announce the block you're mining beforehand, so on finding a solution you usually only need to broadcast the header (and the coinbase - since that's a source of randomness for the block solution too). That should work for faster blocks too, I guess.\n\nBIP-152 is already implemented, and is somewhat similar - nodes begin propagating the block before fully receiving and validating it, sending the header and short IDs (a short hash of transactions, which is likely to identify the TX at the peer).\n\nA miner can start working on the next block given only the header (it's a rather safe bet that the block he is receiving is valid). The more you know about the recently-found block, the better you can choose TXs for the next block you're mining.\n\nThese approaches benefits large blocks slightly more than it does fast blocks, because the per-block overhead and per-transaction overhead are all identical - more TXs per block, less per-block overhead (percentage-wise).\n\nI think weak blocks is more strongly beneficial for large blocks compared to fast blocks - if you think about the case where a pre-announced weak block eliminates the need to forward anything except the header(+coinbase), regardless of block size, the block propagation time is just the time to propagate this header.

And one of the reasons it works is because of speculators placing trust in the exchange.  Since Bitcoin, by itself, is closer to a religion than a ponzi, I suspect Bitcoin will survive if the Bitcoin+USDT ponzi collapses (at least kept alive by the True Believers + whatever transactional use) until someone else starts the next round of Bitcoin-related ponzi and a new influx of speculators appears.\n\nIf Bitcoin speculation won't go away, I'm left wondering if there is a productive way for governments to regulate USDT-style schemes to death without regulating cryptocurrencies in general to death.  I don't know if governments in general are necessarily out to get cryptocurrency as a concept.  But USDT is basically just a way of dodging regulations related to real dollars, so that they can do whatever they want with what is essentially, if not technically, counterfeit money, and have all reputation/benefits of fiat.  Things would get interesting if the law became such that listing a currency that mentioned dollars at all made them accountable to traditional financial system regulations.  For enforcement, it certainly helps that they have a central authority to go after and fiat entry/exit points.  The banning of the [Liberty dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_dollar_(private_currency\\)) might be some sort of vague precedent for this happening.\n\nI guess another possibility is governments creating crypto-fiat (which could atomic-swap to Bitcoin), so that exchanges no longer have an excuse to use their own.  I think it could interest them: it is another vector by which they could manipulate the economy, it could be completely state-controlled (e.g. every public key must be signed by the government and linked to your real life identity), the cost would be extremely low as mining could still be left to the private sector, and it helps kill off something which is clearly a greater evil.

I forgot I am not on /r/BTC\n\nI am absolutely agreeing with you. I read the white paper in spring 2011 and my bitcointalk account was created maybe 3 months after nullc. MtGox was already there. Then came Bitcoinica which was a lot of fun, day trading for crypto kiddies! I think I got liquidated once and then the hack, but it was like under 200 USD I think. Then BTC-E, Bitcoin24, etc etc and finally Bitfinex. Bitfinex, well ... for a scam ... these people put A LOT of work in their platform. I have seen it go from bad to good to the best platform on the market. So I have never believed that these guys where out for a quick scam. But even the best trading platform is kind of dangerous to use when it is completely unregulated (and bitfinex does anything they can to be as severed from the USA as possible) and when you know they got hacked twice and might not be as profitable as they look. \n\n\nAnyway, I was done with crypto because it was useless for anything but gambling on crypto exchanges. Then came Bitcoin Cash and finally I could do something usefull with crypto again.\n\n\nBack to bitfinex. I got liquidated back in late 2014 I think, I send 3 or 4 BTC to them and eventually that turned in to a position worth 4000 USD that got liquidated when I went short but then the price surged to high and back then I was not smart enough to set proper stop losses and just let a big loss happen instead of praying for a miracle. \n\nAnyway ... so from about 2015 to august 2017 I did not do anything in crypto. After my liquidation I had like 20 USD left on Bitfinex which I turned in to 200 USD and turned them in to BCH and send them to my wallet. \n\nThat is kind of my experience with Bitfinex.\n\nThen Tether, I firsts learned about Tether I think September 2017? Probably from some links on /r/btc \n\nAround that time the confusion around the whole scaling debate went away and many of my crypto brothers realized they had been bamboozled by Core. I dove hard in to the scaling debate again and read the white paper another 100 times and finally I got some decent insighs which started my adventures with Bitcoin Cash.\n\nBut suddenly we had this one year where the market cap on all crypto went from 17 B dollars in the beginning of 2017 to over 300 Billion dollars around like october or something? \n\nAnd then I started looking at Tether and this endless stream of altcoins and ICO's and then after Bitcoin Cash came all the wanne be forks. And then if you wanted to, if you where adult enough to tell yourself the truth ... well the whole crypto market became one big scam. \n\nMaking money on the crypto market has been the easiest thing ever, the last 4 months. Why? Because manipulated markets are far more predictable then unregulated ones. As long as you are a small enough fish you won't become a target. Man my Canadians friends started making money left and right ... and yes ACTUALLY cashing out x8 in CAD on their fricking bank accounts. By that time I had already decided that my adventures with Bitcoin Cash where going to be a little more substantial in nature then crypto gambling. \n\nNow fast forward to about december 2017. Now suddenly my mother on facebook wants to know about Bitcoin. And my docter. And my brother. And my exboss invested in this MYCRYPTOMC platform that offers a 1% daily return. But he also resells ASIC's and I have done my best to give him the best possible advice. He is a guy with money and a network and if he had listened to me in 2014 talking about bitcoin. Al he had to do was read that fricking whitepaper. He never did. I am sure if he had reacted differently in 2014 that now he would have a lot of influence in Bitcoin circles in Central-Alberta. Man we could have totally switched his computer business around and started Bitcoin mining before the end of 2014. I never had the money, but I knew some cypherpunks and crazy Chinese guys from fora and stuff. \n\n\nAnyway know that same guy in december 2017 and now with Bitcoin hitting 20 000 CAD when he remember me telling him about Bitcoin when it was like 200 CAD or something? \n\nMan do people ever change in the most naive people in the world when the dollar signs flip on. Holy moly.\n\nSo yeah there you have it, this is my crypto experience ... crypto gambling wise. A bit in a raw form. \n\nYes when Tether goes away everything will be on hold for a while, massive drama galore. Like the [wolf of wallstreet says.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKMpLFCbLz4&feature=youtu.be&t=1081)    if it blows it will crash from like 8000 to like 300 USD in one day but nobody will know it because all the exchanges will be down and the mempool will be 1000 000 unconfirmed transactions. \n\n\nThe guys with enough Bitcoin to have control over the market, and the exchanges that can cheat on their own exchanges. And then Tether .... \nwell those guys don't want to exit the market the first because it's a good business and they are all profiting while fighting each other.\n\nBut NONE OF THESE GUYS WANT TO EXIT THE MARKET THE LAST.\n\n\nAnyway you probably know all of this already. You want the future. It will go up and down for a while ... if Tether blows ... it will just kill the entire crypto market. Tether is the MAIN reason the price of Bitcoin went so high ... and this created the biggest mania since the tulip thing. The mania is real. But is the mania by itself enough to generate a stream of incoming fiat that will become bigger exponentially?  No I don't think so. Because belief is a fickle thing. And so is tether.  This is going to blow up bad, but only those with enough power to have it blow up know when. It's a game of goose\n\nThe goose is going to be horribly slaughtered and the gold coins won't be there. \n\n\nYes, Bitcoin will survive but it might need another 10 years again ... which I don't mind. I am so sick of people having NO interest in the white paper and just want to get rich tomorrow. \n\nI want a currency. I want a payment system. I want to go to superstore and buy pizza and pay in crypto using my phone and for that to work good I need some kind of price stability. I want to lifestream my music and have people from all over the world tip me in crypto. \n\nSo the faster it blows the better. My job for now is to help all my friends so they don't loose to much money. And many already made really nice returns. It's amazing how smart people sometimes mis out on good financial opportunities because they think to hard while the simple guys that don't read the white paper just go all in on some penny stock cryptos and within 4 months walk away with x8 on a 10 000 CAD investment. Almost makes me a bit jealous. Then again I don't have any money to invests with, which is kind of nice ... no worries. No agenda! Just give me my magic internet money!

So person B decides to do a cpfp. He creates a transaction (T2) using the outputs from T1 (and possibly other outputs from his wallet) which sends money to person C and puts a fee of 50 sat/byte + however much 40 sat/byte would be for the previous transaction. This way, if you combine T1 and T2 together, their combined fee rate is 50 sat/byte. At this point, the miners have both transactions sitting in their mempools and since they can't confirm T2 without also confirming T1, and the fee on T2 is high enough to be worth adding both the under-feed T1 in addition to the over-feed T2, so a miner will include both transactions in the same block, one after another.

I wonder if you have an opinion on that.\n\nSo is it okay to trust miners? Is it okay to trust developers? Or do you think it is possible to continue to increase the block size and still have the users be in control?\n\nI personally think users need to be in control, and this requires a limited block size. As a result, fees are higher than I would like, but I think the alternative is worse. A system with trust is no better than PayPal. The BCH blockchain (and many other alts) has to become a lot bigger before we get to that point, but it's heading into that direction.\n\n", 2], ["2017-12-30 21:26:59", "Hey! Thanks for a more great write-up! :)\n\nI guess you are right about where we disagree. I do not see archival nodes helping with decentralization.\n\nThe most problematic aspect with decentralization in Bitcoin (both BTC and BCH) is that mining has become geographically centralized in China. The Chinese government can effectively censor certain transactions/addresses by issuing legal orders forcing the miners to classify all blocks having those transactions as invalid. And since more than 50% of the hash power is controlled by Chinese mining pools, they will *always* succeed. A million people running archival nodes would not be able to *anything* to prevent that.\n\nThe second biggest risk to decentralization is obviously the high fees. If the only thing you can do with Bitcoin is to hold it and then later convert it to fiat or other cryptocurrencies through centralized institutions like exchanges, requiring you to have bank accounts or be KYC/AML compliant... then the whole point of having a censorship-resistant currency like Bitcoin goes in vain. I think the only way Bitcoin can remain censorship-resistant is if it is being widely used for many many different use cases, so that you rarely - if ever - have to exchange your coins for fiat currency using centralized institutions.\n\nI also find the centralization of the client-software problematic. The more dependent the network is on a particular implementation, the more power the developers have over decision-making. A few select developers can possibly veto necessary upgrades to the client software. And I do not see that as a good thing. And while developers may have the best intentions, it is possible for a small group of people to be terribly wrong. It is also possible that developers will look after their own interests more than listening to the needs of the users. They might find it more interesting to work on more interesting but less necessary upgrades instead of the boring but necessary upgrades. I believe Emin Gun Sirer wrote a very good article on this problem (I'll add a link if I find it later). It's just better to have competition between several clients and not be too reliant on one particular implementation.\n\nComing back to the point about it being necessary to validate all transactions going back to the genesis block, I don't think that it would bring any additional functionality to most users. Apart from it being a bit cool to run an archival node, it doesn't really do much if you are a normal user. *An archival node cannot reject blocks* (it may only detect them). Only mining nodes can reject blocks by choosing to not work on them. If all miners decide to change consensus rules and if you refuse to follow them, your node would just be ignored and get stuck at a particular block. And if there is a chain split with hash power being divided into two groups, again, your node is wholly unnecessary and adds nothing to the scenario. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinDiscussion/comments/7m0r2z/which_is_more_important_for_security_hash_rate_or/drql9tf/) is a conversation in another thread in this sub in which I explained why I thought that archival nodes don't really provide any additional functionality over SPV wallets.\n\n> I linked to this post, which gives the example that Segwit2x could not have been prevented without the ability to run full nodes. I wonder if you have an opinion on that.\n\nS2X was prevented because it was trading at around ~0.1 to ~0.2 BTC in the future's market. Miners would have lost money if they had followed through with that. They just made the most prudent financial decision they could, it didn't have anything to do with what archival nodes were signalling. The S2X fork would have been prevented by the future's market even if there were like only 5 or 10 archival nodes running. User consensus is enforced by the market, not hobbyists running archival nodes. \n\n> So is it okay to trust miners? Is it okay to trust developers? Or do you think it is possible to continue to increase the block size and still have the users be in control?\n\nI do not think it is okay to trust anyone. Anyone can be compromised, including the developers. However, I do believe that the incentive system for Bitcoin mining has a very effective Nash equilibrium and it works (as it has shown over the last 9 years). So, I'm not really worried about miners doing something very egregious all by themselves. They will always find it profitable to *follow* the market than to make their own rules. This incentive system works pretty well to disincentivize malicious miners.\n\nThis is another reason why I like Bitcoin Cash over other non-PoW coins like Ripple or DASH (I have nothing against those two coins in particular though, I'll use them if I need to). The incentive mechanism for Bitcoin is very good and it works. But with Ripple (and even DASH), it'd be far more easier to censor addresses or transactions than with BCH.\n\nAnother advantage that BCH has is that it's primary objective seems to be to work as a day-to-day currency and things like merchant and user adoption are prioritized. That means that I can possibly *use* those coins in the real world without having to exchange it for fiat currency. Like I said before, without that feature, I find the whole point of having a censorship-resistant currency futile.\n\n> I personally think users need to be in control, and this requires a limited block size. \n\nI do not agree with this.\n\nI feel that users are in control by default because of the way mining is incentivized. \n\nA limited block size, however, causes high fees, and that takes control *away* from users. Nearly 50% of all BTC addresses have amounts less than the fees that it would take to move them. More than 60% of all BTC UTXOs are unspendable now because of high fees. Users did *not* choose that. The power to spend those coins was taken away from users without their consent by limiting block size.\n\n\n> Storage is not the bottleneck. You can run a pruned node and have the same security guarantees as a non-pruned node without requiring a lot of storage.\n\nYes, I agree. I wasn't saying that storage is a bottleneck. I only made that point because you mentioned storage. I was just pointing out that the cost of storing *all* transactions over a year on the entire network would be less than the cost of making a single transaction. Which is an awfully skewed ratio. :)\n\n> It causes Bitmain to earn roughly 10% more profit than competitors, which pushes other miners out of profitability range. It is also patented, and it causes miners to fight against protocol upgrades that would be beneficial for users, but kill asicboost as a side effect, as we saw with segwit.\n\nI don't think that it is actually unfair. Other miners can implement the same or more improved techniques or even develop better ASICs that make mining more efficient for themselves. Bitmain can't stop them from doing that. It's fair competition from my perspective. (I do not like patents, just to be clear, and would indeed like mining to be more fairer... but, even then, proprietary mining techniques aren't really unfair).", 1], ["2018-01-02 21:40:01", ">Hey!

[...] A million people running archival nodes would not be able to anything to prevent that.\n\nI agree. Mining is too centralized at the moment, and while that does not allow them to change the rules, it does allow them to start censoring transactions. Firing miners is an option if things get out of hand, but I don't think it's a very good one.\n\n>The second biggest risk to decentralization is obviously the high fees. If the only thing you can do with Bitcoin is to hold it and then later convert it to fiat or other cryptocurrencies through centralized institutions like exchanges, requiring you to have bank accounts or be KYC/AML compliant...\n\nI half agree.

It's just better to have competition between several clients and not be too reliant on one particular implementation.\n\nI have a very different view on this, but I think I understand why you view it in this way. My view is approximately as follows:\n\n- Users decide what software they run, not devs. It's a free market.\n- As with any free market, it is not easy to dethrone the dominant player, but it certainly isn't impossible.\n- This is not just the case with dev teams, but also with hard forks: status quo is always easier, as it requires no action.\n- Since we've never had a hard fork, you can choose to run any Bitcoin release all the way back to the ones from Satoshi.\n- The Core devs follow the process of rough consensus, which means new features should not come at the cost of existing ones, and all technical concerns need to be adequately addressed. I highly recommend reading up on it [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7282), and I talk about it in one of my posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinDiscussion/comments/7jv2kd/what_is_consensus/dr9tkyv/).\n- I highly value rough consensus because I can verify the process myself, by reading the public discussion of developers, such as on the bitcoin mailing list. It requires technical knowledge, but this is what allows us to go beyond blindly trusting developers.\n- In my opinion Core devs have done nothing but add and improve features, while preserving existing ones. People often ask them to make compromises, but they are right to dismiss them, because this would please some, but upset others.\n- Multiple implementations are only safe for non-consensus changes, as I mention [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6z827o/chris_jeffrey_jj_discloses_bitcoin_attack_vector/dmuhb6j/).\n\n>If all miners decide to change consensus rules and if you refuse to follow them, your node would just be ignored and get stuck at a particular block.\n\nIf all users decide to change consensus rules and if miners refuse to follow them, their blocks would just be ignored. It is the same power, as long as users have the ability to run nodes. I'd argue users have more power, because users are the ones who pay miners. If users and miners don't follow each other, users are merely inconvenienced with a frozen network, while miners are losing their income.\n\n>And if there is a chain split with hash power being divided into two groups, again, your node is wholly unnecessary and adds nothing to the scenario. Here is a conversation in another thread\n>>You just use a choose an SPV wallet that follows your preferred chain\n\nYou can do that, but you would be trusting miners. If everybody ran SPV wallets, miners can steal coins. You may think this is not likely to happen, but do you agree that this is objectively lower security?\n\n>The S2X fork would have been prevented by the future's market even if there were like only 5 or 10 archival nodes running.

This incentive system works pretty well to disincentivize malicious miners.\n\nI would argue full nodes are an integral part of that equilibrium. If you can't run your own full node, becoming a validator is no longer permissionless.\n\nMiners would have no incentive not to cheat if absolutely nobody but a few miners were able to run full nodes, so I assume we both agree that is not okay. There needs to be some kind of balance. I'm not sure what you think is reasonable, but let's say nodes cost $20k/month, and let's say 50 people (exchanges + miners) run nodes. We'll assume users don't care as long as they get some SPV proof that says their transaction made it in a block.\n\nNow let's say a new person comes in, number 51. First of all, it would be very costly to catch up and verify the entire history. Second, those 50 miners would need to actually send him all that data. If they wanted, they could refuse. So really, the entire system is run by 50 people, and they have the power to veto any new member.\n\nWell, now we're back to Ripple. Why not just have 50 validators who run the network, and get rid of all this costly mining with meaningless SPV proofs?\n\n>More than 60% of all BTC UTXOs are unspendable now because of high fees.

You could switch to mining bch or other currencies with similar hash algorithms, but even if you gained 99% of the hashpower in those currencies, you wouldn't be making nearly as much as you were with bitcoin.

Once they perform their attack, they can switch back to bitcoin and may not care if they've destroyed bch. \n\nSo the way that I see it, the cost of the hardware is what differentiates attacks on the coin with the largest amount of hashpower from ones with small fractions of that amount of hashpower.

Mining fluctuates between the two depending on that profitability. \n\nThis scenario is particularly ...doable on the bch chain because it competes for mining power with btc; miners can mine both with the same rigs, and do. \n\nRight now about 7% of hash power is on the bch chain. 93% on btc. \n\nIf 7.1% of that mining power on the btc chain collaborated they could switch to the bch chain and 51% attack it. \n\nI don\u2019t think that is likely at 7%, but it gets more and more so as less and less power is on the bch chain. \n\nA 51% attack allows whoever is doing it to *secretly* mine a *longer, more valid* chain than the public one, while transacting as they please on the public chain.

But the same cars would have stored value better than milk, if you had purchased it at the same time. \n\nBecause everything is relative, a *good* store of value is something that can store value *better* than other stores of value.

It is derived from the fact that it is a metal that is corrosion resistant, relatively scarce, is a strong conductor, and is chemically inert (relatively speaking, of course). Corrosion resistance was what first brought gold into the spotlight, but we're a long way from there.\n\nThese properties mean that people will *always* value gold, both from a technological standpoint (gold-plated wires) as well as from an aesthetic standpoint (jewelry). \n\nGo over [this](http://www.usfunds.com/slideshows/the-many-uses-of-gold/#.Wg8TDUqWaUl) link, and tell me if you can satisfy all those use-cases with silver (not corrosion resistant), palladium (*extremely* rare - all the Palladium mined to date can fit inside your living room. Hence restricted to industrial use-cases), or platinum(comparable, but harder to procure and work). Natural resources like gold, water, oxygen simply cannot be replaced by something else, because *there is nothing else available that replicate their properties completely.*\n\nNow Bitcoin is a crypto-currency. It's a digital, decentralized payments ledger that is trustlessly maintained by parties acting in their own self-interests. From a purely *functional* perspective, ANYTHING Bitcoin can do can be done atleast equally well by a number of competitors.\n\nI agree that Bitcoin's unique value is derived from the trust that people have in it. But, like you implied, that trust *could* be lost some day. Which means its value is propped up because the market trusts it to be valued as it is. Bitcoin is an idea given shape - people can easily lose trust in ideas a la Tulip-mania (although historians believe it didn't really occur!).

The transaction ID (TXID) is determined by hashing the entire transaction, including the signature(s).\n\nIn order to spend from that transaction's UTXOs, one must reference the TXID.  Signatures used in Bitcoin can actually be altered but still be valid, which changes the TXID.  So that means that after I broadcast a transaction, a miner could alter the signature slightly before including it in a block.  This wouldn't change anything that happens within the transaction itself (they can't steal funds this way), but it *would* completely change the TXID.  This risk also exists for situations where you share your transaction with someone else before it is broadcasted - that person could alter the signature and then broadcast it with a different TXID(*).\n\nFor most normal use-cases this isn't a major problem, since you can just wait until the transaction is confirmed, and then you'll know that the TXID won't change.  However, it is a hassle for wallets being able to track your transactions.  The even bigger problem is that it seriously messes with any sort of procedure that requires someone to know a TXID before broadcasting it(*).\n\nNow, segwit solves this by having the segwit UTXO signatures not be included in the hash to create the TXID (they are stored elsewhere).  It does not, however, change anything about existing UTXO types, such as P2SH or P2PKH.  So if you want to make it possible for third parties to change the TXID without your permission, you can *still do this using the other transaction types*.  I can't imagine a scenario where you'd want to do this, but you still have the option!\n\nBasically, segwit doesn't prevent transaction malleability altogether.  It just gives you the *option* to create non-malleable transactions.\n\n-----------------\n\n(*)Bi-directional payment channels, required for lightning and other things, are opened in this way (this will also answer your question, u/yamaha20).\n\nTo open a bi-direction channel, both parties create a funding transaction that sends their funds to a 2of2 multisig UTXO.  They don't sign it yet.  Then, they create a commitment transaction that will send the funds back to each party.  Then, party A signs the funding transaction and sends it to Party B to sign and broadcast. This makes sure that no one can hold the other party hostage and the funds don't get stuck.\n\nWith transaction malleability, this doesn't work.  Because if Party B decides to cheat and alters a signature on the funding transaction before broadcasting it, the commitment transaction will be useless, because it won't refer to the correct TXID, so Party B can now hold the funds hostage.\n\nNow, I have heard that some research has been done that suggest there is a way around this, but that it is far less efficient (requires a much more complicated procedure).  So while having transaction malleability isn't strictly necessary, it is *highly desirable* for lightning, and other reasons (like making it simpler for wallet software to track UTXOs).  And these are just two of many examples.\n\n-----------------\n\nIn summary, even if transaction malleability were to be a useful feature for something (which I doubt), you can still \"use\" it, if you like.\n\nAnd one more thing: while this isn't a technical argument, I think it's also worth noting that the opponents of segwit are generally still in favor of fixing transaction malleability, although they favor other methods (such as flexible transactions and extension blocks).

That doesn't mean the ideas behind are necessarily bad.  And the shifting of incentives to validate signatures seems like an issue worth considering to me, whether or not the lecture is BS.\n\n> His argument can be summed up as: Miners could hardfork to chain the segwit rules back to 'anyonecanspend' and then steal everyone's coins.\n>\n> The debunking goes: miners could already do this just as easily to any other existing type of transaction.\n\nAs I understand it this was never the question.  I would summarize the interesting parts of the lecture as \"segwit makes it easier for a hashpower minority to make validating signatures an unstable strategy\".  I am not particularly knowledgeable about bitcoin and segwit so maybe I got completely the wrong ideas but here's what I got from thinking about the lecture:\n\n1. It may be much easier to get high gamma compared to the [original](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0243v2.pdf) selfish mining attack if the attackers' block intentionally includes only one segwit transaction, making the witness data negligibly small compared to the block size.  I imagine this becomes even more relevant the more blocksize you want bitcoin to have.  If alpha can realistically be very low number, the cost of the attack may cross some profitability threshold.\n2. The attackers' chain is not some private collusion thing like regular selfish mining.  Every miner can see what is happening and can independently decide whether or not they want to switch to not validating segwit signatures.  One consequence of this is that for miners choosing to join after alpha is crossed, there is no _atomic_ decision of \"do I collude with n other miners to kill segwit/bitcoin and harm my own business or not\".  Whether or not they want to strategically withhold segwit signatures from their own blocks or fraudulently spend segwit outputs themselves is besides the point.  They are actively losing money until they stop validating segwit signatures, so there is only one equilibrium at that point which is that everyone stops validating segwit signatures and after segwit is shown to be insecure, bitcoin goes back to functioning normally, just without segwit (and the attack does not threaten to completely destroy miners' business, although it would surely have consequences).\n3. Another consequence of this is that there are no questions about \"but what if the attackers collude to recursively selfish mine against each other until their scheme collapses\" which I think people had about the selfish mining paper.\n4. In the lecture this distinction was ignored and the numbers were copied from the original paper, but I think gamma does not tell the whole story.  There is also the question of how many people mine on top of the attacker block _before_ a competing block is found, which includes not only the attacker pool but also anyone who is not validating segwit signatures (including for example SPV miners mining an empty block on top of it), which is impossible in an attack based on a secret chain.\n\nI don't particularly believe the attack will happen in practice, but I don't have enough information to dismiss it either.  So if someone had a strong argument that it doesn't work at all, I would be interested to hear it.\n\nEdited for better distinction between attackers' behavior and defectors' behavior", 2], ["2017-10-04 01:36:46", "Ok, I couldn't recall what the gamma and alpha meant in this context, so I went back to rewatch the video again (I hadn't seen it in 3 months)....and I was reminded of something:\n\nYou realize that his entire argument is built on the premise that there are no full nodes running anymore, right?\n\nAs long as businesses and users still have full nodes running, any miners cheating as described here will simply be forked off the network and be mining worthless blocks.\n\nIf the entire community just trusts the miners to be enforcing full rules and don't validate, then yes, we're kind of fucked, I agree.  But if we ever get to that point, segwit will be the least of our worries, because it means that the entire community has basically given up on the project.", 3], ["2017-10-04 04:52:06", "I'm not sure if trying to spend segwit outputs fraudulently is a necessary goal, even if the lecture claimed it was possible.  And the rest of the attack still generates valid segwit blocks that would eventually be validated by fullnodes once the signatures are released.  \n\nThe fact that fullnodes would reject the attacker chain until the witness data is released also makes me wonder about withholding for several blocks in order to double-spend.  Normally this kind of attack would be very expensive, but if you have already trained miners to not validate segwit signatures, then your block is very likely to remain in the main chain.\n\nAlso, I wonder if some fungibility properties are lost due to segwit outputs possibly having a weaker security model.  For example, let's say your business refuses segwit payments, but the UTXO set is 50% segwit.  Is there a point where it is in your interest to execute the selfish mining attack in order to lower the market value of everyone else's coins and increase the scarcity of your own holdings?  \n\nBut this is all assuming the incentives to not validate are the same as I thought.  Now that you mention it, I guess that assumption isn't good either.  Supposing the equilibrium were that no miner validates segwit signatures, then any block mined with invalid signatures would cause a fork from the fullnodes and a better strategy would be to not mine on the forked chain.  Even if those blocks are never generated by buggy mining software, a miner could even intentionally generate such blocks sometimes to sabotage all their competition.  So it cannot be an equilibrium.\n\nHmm, so miners have four options:\n\n1.  Ignore segwit signatures\n\n2.  Validate segwit signatures\n\n3.  Ignore segwit signatures and withhold segwit signatures\n\n4.  Validate segwit signatures and withhold segwit signatures\n\nThe fact that #4 is an option means each mining pool could independently withhold with its own separate alpha (it will always mine on top of its own withhold block, even if it does not mine on others' withhold blocks).\n\nI think more ignore encourages more withhold due to the observation about the global ignore rate effectively counting as alpha in some ways.  More withhold also encourages more ignore, up to a certain point.  But the higher the ignore rate, ignore becomes more and more costly, due to the risks of mining invalid sigs.  \n\nI would guess there is an equilibrium where all of 1,2,3, and 4 have nonzero representation, and maybe there is also an equilibrium where nobody withholds because too many miners are validating for it to be profitable.  It would take coordinated action by significant hashpower to disrupt that equilibrium by withholding, but after it happened, ignore rates would increase, potentially opening up profitable withholding to more miners.  Miners with high gamma and pool size would profit at the expense of those who don't have the resources to withhold.\n\nHigh gamma also makes validate more profitable compared to ignore (higher chance of your block propagating before withheld signatures do).  Small miners might prefer honest mining, miners with poor connections might prefer ignore, well-connected miners might prefer validate, and large miners might prefer withhold.  Large, well-connected miners could add another advantage to their list of advantages should this scenario occur.  Mining centralization is part of bitcoin anyway, so it's not clear to me if this changes the security at all or by how much.  That being said, increased ignore rates seem detrimental no matter what.  Some miners might not even validate any transactions as-is, but nonzero withholding would skew incentives even more.  Would it make a big difference, or would it change the validation rate by 0.1%?  I don't know.  Does anyone know?\n\nIs it worth it for a big miner to become the first withholder?  What if you are a big miner, frequently send bitcoin transactions that you could double spend in your withhold blocks, and hold primarily non-segwit outputs that you mined over the past n years?\n\nI guess I should also consider that segwit is a type of block size increase.  A fair comparison might be something like 500kB segwit blocks vs 1MB non-segwit blocks, in which case it's not clear whether the effects on mining centralization and on signature ignore rate would add up to be positive or negative.\n\nWell, those are my thoughts.

Even if B doesn't, some nodes on the rest of the network may have bandwidth restrictions such that receiving 1MB+ takes somewhat longer than it does to ping them*.  Meanwhile, regardless of the block size, A's message (one witness) is negligibly small.\n\n* Suppose A has nodes strategically installed in various places on the geographical/internet connectivity graph.  A could secretly copy the witness data to these nodes _before_ B's block is found.  Each node could then release the witness data as soon as it sees B's announcement (and if it sees A's announcement, it will propagate it like normal).  A node installed near B would mean even nodes that have much lower ping to B than to A have a decent chance to see A's message first.  Additionally, since A's nodes propagate either A or B --> A, but it is impossible for a node that has not seen B's message to propagate A --> B, you can imagine A's message will diffuse more efficiently.

But I genuinely don't know.\n\nI always imagined that nodes receiving an invalid block would just dump it instead of keeping it.

And will they accept the witness data separately?\n\nNow that you mention it, and looking at the block structure, I guess the witness data for each transaction is still included in the transaction data, and it's just the witness merkle tree that is completely separate from the transaction merkle tree.  So splitting a block into transaction and witness data is a complicated operation.  I think the lecture did not make a clear distinction between validating mempool transactions, and validating already-mined blocks, which probably led to some conflation.  \n\nEven if it's nontrivial, I wonder if miners might still have an incentive to move to a protocol where blocks are split for optimization reasons, regardless of what the current implementation is.  (Download less data, and still be able to mine transactions on top of a block without the risk of including double-spends because you can still validate the transaction merkle root without knowing the witness data.)  Non-mining fullnodes do not have to agree to the miners' optimized protocol because once the whole valid block is assembled by some miners, they could send it to the non-mining fullnodes using the regular protocol.  And storing base blocks without the associated witness data does not open up a DoS attack so long as you only accept witness data for a base block (with PoW) that you have already seen.\n\nI think you can also make the argument that most of this may technically be possible without segwit.  Suppose miners could define a new inter-miner protocol where any amount of signature data can be stripped from a block and retrieving it is an optional additional query.  Regardless of implementation practicality, there is still a difference in this case: now you cannot prove that a transaction without a signature belongs in the merkle tree at all.  This means if your strategy is to download the transactions, start mining, and then download the signatures, then there is a huge risk that an adversary could take a valid block and replace some transactions with bogus transactions (optimally with as many coins transferred, inputs, and outputs as possible).  There's no way of knowing this happened since you can't check the merkle tree without the signatures anyway.  If you mine on top of this block, you may lose fee revenue to any legitimate transactions that happen to look like double-spends of the bogus inputs, and you may include invalid transactions that depend on the bogus outputs.  In other words, I think there is no legitimate reason for miners to want to use this protocol compared to just SPV mining, which might not be true for segwit.", 1], ["2017-10-06 00:40:06", "> I wonder if miners might still have an incentive to move to a protocol where blocks are split for optimization reasons, regardless of what the current implementation is.\n\nYeah, I guess that is a concern.

Additionally, the transaction data themselves are being sent both before and after they are confirmed.  So, much of what I wrote is based on incorrect assumptions.\n\nCompact blocks would seem to make witness-withholding easy to execute since all the block surgery is already being done by any serious miner.  And there is no need for a new miner protocol with a witness-only message.  I think due to the soft fork properties, you could broadcast the segwit transaction as a regular anyone-can-spend legacy transaction, then mine a block and according to compact blocks broadcast the correct list of wtxids (which will prompt segwit-validating nodes to start looking for the missing transaction), and then later broadcast the full transaction with witness data.  The size of the addendum would still be order of 1kB.  \n\nHowever, the ability to get high gamma is much less than my original impression.  One transaction is competing not with a whole block measured in MB but with the list of txids in the block, which is also measured in kB, so I guess they are both just latency-bound (and the honest validating node has at least 1 hop advantage).

Bitcoin presently acts as a scarce digital commodity with a finite supply. The finite supply and deflationary pressures make Bitcoin highly speculative. Bitcoin's value lies in its network effect and a first mover advantage, which makes it vulnerable to potentially superior cryptocurrencies. The biggest obstacle preventing Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to fiat currencies is its volatility. Bitcoin's volatility is far larger than even fiat currencies with a small supply. \n\nIn the last two years, Bitcoin has been the most traded in China. Historically, China is followed by the United States and then by the European Union and Japan. Therefore, it is fair to assume that China is the most significant external factor that will influence Bitcoin's volatility, followed by the United States, the European Union and then Japan. The macroeconomic explanatory variables of China, U.S. and European Union are all significant to forecast next day's volatility of Bitcoin, which indicates that Bitcoin is starting to react to the same variables as the fiat currencies in these countries. Japan's macroeconomic variables are not significant, however.\n\nBitcoin's volatility is the most sensitive to the price changes in CNY, which further points to the centralization of Bitcoin. Currently, macroeconomic shocks from China, the U.S. and the EU affect Bitcoin disproportionately more than shocks from other countries. In order for Bitcoin to truly become an international alternative to fiat currencies, it must become more independent of the larger countries. \n\nHowever, the volatility levels have historically been trending downward and if Bitcoin were to follow the same trend as in the last six years, it would reach the volatility levels of fiat currencies approximately in 2019-2020. However, the absence of the central bank that acts as a minimizer of the systematic risk and a stabilizer of the exchange rate means that Bitcoin might never reach the volatility levels of stable fiat currencies. Nonetheless, volatility will surely approach the fiat levels when the traded daily volume is sufficient. If Bitcoin approaches the volatility levels of fiat currencies, it will satisfy the criteria of being a functioning currency and therefore will be ready for mass adoption. In the long run, Bitcoin has potential to become a global reserve currency.\n", 3], ["2017-04-18 18:43:01", "I'd meant to reply to this earlier, but didn't get a chance to.\n\nSeems very well put together, and paints a rather optimistic picture, volatility-wise.\n\nWhen it comes to this statement:\n\n>The biggest obstacle preventing Bitcoin from becoming an alternative to fiat currencies is its volatility.\n\nI think you might be slightly overstating the importance of volatility.

Plus potentially a new upgrade mechanism requiring us to predict what happens if the economy tries to get something through against the wishes of the miners, not to mention how you tell what the economy wants in the first place.\n\nThese things will doubtless have more unintended consequences, resulting in more clever ideas from the clever people, resulting in...", 2], ["2017-04-18 19:12:26", "Sure, I'll give it a go.  AFAICT, there are two main issues here harming the status quo; covert asicboost (a) Encourages Miner Centralization, and (b) Impedes Useful Upgrades\n\n------------------------------\n\n(a) The centralization issue (as I understand it) is an unfortunate side-effect of varying patents held in different countries, and how patent laws differ across international borders.  If patent laws didn't exist, I don't believe this would be an issue.\n\nUnfortunately (at least in this case), they do, which means that within China, only Bitmain can use asicboost.  In other regions, to my knowledge, parties which are not mining hold the patent.  Considering that cost-effective mining is still limited to certain regions (reasons related to weather, infrastructure, cost of electricity, etc), there already exist challenges to decentralization.\n\nNow we are in a scenario where only one company is legally allowed to use a technique that offers a substantial boost to efficiency (30% theoretical, I've heard in practice it's more like 20%).  In a competitive industry that has thin profit margins (as has bitcoin mining), this is a *massive* advantage.  If there is an industry with 5% profit margins, and you get a 20% boost to efficiency, you can pretty well establish a monopoly (all else being equal, of course).\n\n------------------------------\n\n(b) The existence of this technique is an accident of how the data from blockheaders is arrange before being hashed.  It allows miners using it to essentially fake doing more work than they actually have - they haven't actually done the full amount of work required to produce the hash.**\n\nI'm noting this because the PoW algorithm was meant to function the same way, even if a future upgrade shifts around the data in a block header or requires a miner to commit to a certain order of transactions.  Asicboost, however, would be affected by these things.  Considering that many useful upgrades and features might depend on such changes, it stands to reason that incentives are misaligned - a minority of miners will have reason to block advantageous upgrades because it will cost them money.\n\n------------------------------\n\nIn summary:\n\n(a) Existing patent laws mean this technique gives a huge advantage to a single company in China, which will encourage mining centralization.\n\n(b) It provides financial incentive for a minority of hashpower to block useful upgrades.\n\n**This is why, cryptographically speaking, it is technically an \"attack\".

(a skilled work might require another shitload of training effort and time beforehand, so let's keep the thought experiment simple to the pure labor work)\n\nIf your answer is not 2, then someone can energy arbitrage against you.  So, don't you think it is the laborious searching of rare sea shells that determines the value of the money ?  \n\nA delicate difference between scarce materials and bitcoin is that the difficulty of the rare sea shell is somewhat fixed and determined by Mother Nature while the difficulty of bitcoin is adjustable.  With constant difficulty and fixed amount of money, the economy that powered by the shells money is up to a limit.  While Satoshi has no idea how large the size of the economy that powered by bitcoin could be and designs the difficulty to be adjustable, the logic about the origin of the money value is the same. \n\n> If the price will drop many miners will simply go offline.

But it is kind of uncertainty about the future, such as:\n\n* The traditional economy is supported by the petrochemical energy.  With the impact of climate change, the desire of survive may outwin the desire of consumption and therefore the economy would shrink.  The 15.3t USD base money assumption may shrink as well.\n* Just like Robinson Crusoe does not need any money, a more homestead style of living in the future may decrease the necessity of money even a higher living standard is achieved by having a higher energy per capita.  While people can collect energy by the Solar panels, they can weed for tomato by the robot rather than hire someone for weeding and pay money for the work.\n* With the energy power on Earth from the Sun being on average 342.5W per meter^2, 8.1871E+10W requires 239 km^2.\n\nSo, I tend to not taking these flavor of reasoning seriously.

And so, if money costs half as much, then it is Worth half as much. This is why you think that the price of buying flowers, and biscuits and charging batteries on the ship doubles - because everybody has access to half price money.  \n  \nThat's wrong and crazy for a number of reasons. Firstly, you said that the energy that the spaceship gets is from solar panels - with a fixed \"energy income\". This strongly implies that the recycler does not pay for electricity. (this is why in my original response I simplified the scenario making me the electricity producer - at cost - to the recycler - you).  \n  \nSecondly, the money supply/volume is fixed. You can't buy significant amounts of money.  \n  \nSo, we work that through - recycling does not cost anything and is just \"At a maximum\" meaning that 1% of gold goes into AND COMES OUT OF electronics each year keeping the total money volume (not gold in electronics) at 99kg. The cost of buying gold would be 1:1 - because you said this was a stable economy, and so it could not be profit making - otherwise the recycler would end up with all the money. \n  \nTo recap: if electricity has no cost - then the thought experiment is pointless because there is no impact on gold supply or prices.  \n  \nSo, to make it interesting, we could say that money either has a money cost, or a time cost. Let's do money.  \n  \nSo, I am the only source of electricity on the spaceship. \n  \nThe recyclers must buy electricity off me. I therefor \"control\" the supply of new money. If I don't give them electricity the total amount of gold is reduced by 1% each year. This is not the end of the world. As long as gold (like bitcoin) is \"infinitely divisible\" then we could have a functioning economy on 1g of gold in total. We would be able to produce proportionately less electronics each year, in this daft example, but hey. You also have deflation, because everybody's wages would be falling, the incentive to spend would not be there. etc.\n  \nSo, I'll play the game better. So now, I produce electricity, but it costs me a FIXED amount of gold. Bear with me here, this is going to have to be a bit silly.  \nSo to make electricity on the solar panels, I put gold outside and it makes electricity, but becomes radioactive (so it is dead to me) but the de-radioactivating guy reintroduces it to the ship's supply, but I can't do that. And it doesn't cost him any energy or gold. )  \n  \nIn other words - producing gold costs a fixed amount of money (resource), but the total volume of money on the ship remains unchanged.  \n  \nNow - this outcome is actually different than I thought it would be.   \n  \nTo re-cycle 1g of gold costs 5g gold of electricity.  \n  \nIt is not ever in anybody's interest to pay 5g for 1g. Except, the radio-deactivating guy. He pays 5g and gets 1g electricity. He ends up with 6g gold. But most importantly - we need electricity on the ship, so the the radio-deactivating guy would actually be the government. But even if it wasn't, we still need the money to come back into the economy somehow. Ok, forget that.  \n  \nSo how about To re-cycle 1g of gold costs 5g gold worth of labour time _at current prices_. Now, as the money supply shrinks, gold prices decrease for everything - including my labour time, until we get to a point where it costs me <1g labour to get 1g gold. Then (in theory) the price of everything stabilises, forever. In this example there would be a large stockpile of waste-with-gold-in. Once I get half-way through, my wage rises above 1g threshold and I get a job in a cinema. \n  \nThis example also works if we have an unlimited external source of gold. Scooping from passing asteroids. Again, at a fixed labour cost, at some point there's enough money in the economy that I get paid better to make cakes. (in this stable economy). \n  \nSo, let's try a different one. The electricity comes from a radioactive core, on the ship - which takes TIME to produce electricity for recycling gold. (it's B-electricity which is useless in any other way).  \n  \nIn this example, gold can only be recycled at a certain rate. If that's faster than 1kg/year then we have maximum gold volume permanently.

It would be great if we had an entirely equivalent version of Bitcoin (including network effect, price, etc) with bigger blocks to see the effects, but that's not going to happen anytime soon.  There's BCH, which is almost certainly more centralized in terms of mining, but even though it backs up my perspective, I don't think it would be fair for me to use that as evidence since there are a myriad of other factors at play there...\n\n> The causes of miner centralization are primarily electricity prices, labor rates, and engineering and manufacturing capacity. Until and unless those problems are solved, miner centralization is going to persist.\n\nI agree that these are all significant factors.  But bigger blocks would make it worse.\n\n> You can (and, in fact, already do) have a fee market without full blocks. It would also be much more predictable and robust than a fee market with full blocks.\n\nDo you mean by just having a flat fee, and no full blocks?  Why do you think that this would be more predictable and robust?  In any case, I have a feeling that we're going to get back to the disagreement about whether or not non-mining nodes are useful, because that's where this leads...\n\nAs I said originally, perhaps this debate is outside the scope of the article, so I'm not going to plant a flag here for this particular discussion.\n\n> Bitcoin is not that far off where miner centralization is concerned. I would think that if blocksize/weight were a major factor with regard to miner centralization, that Bitcoin Cash would be dramatically more centralized, **but it is not**. I believe that's because other factors have much more influence on miner centralization than the size of blocks does.\n\n(Bolding is mine) How do we know that?  Aren't more than 40% of blocks mined by [unknown entities](https://cash.coin.dance/blocks) in BCH?

I have never, ever seen real evidence that larger block sizes and corresponding increases in block transmission times have had any impact on miner centralization.\n\nOne could point out, as blocks were getting bigger, miners were getting more centralized.  \nHowever there are too many parameters that can affect this, so I believe this logic is not sufficient. The main thing to realize: there is literally no better empirical evidence to support or debunk the connection, than this, so your argument is: \"I didn't see any evidence the Yeti doesn't exists, so it must exist.\" This is a common fallacy.  \nHowever, what we have is a straightforward theory.\n\n> You can (and, in fact, already do) have a fee market without full blocks. It would also be much more predictable and robust than a fee market with full blocks.  \n\nI tend to agree with you on this point. In theory miners would mine smaller blocks to bump up fees to some levels to keep them alive. Yet, I'm not 100% convinced.  \n\n> Bitcoin is not that far off where miner centralization is concerned. I would think that if blocksize/weight were a major factor with regard to miner centralization, that Bitcoin Cash would be dramatically more centralized, but it is not.  \n\nIt is. No matter how you count it, you'll get about 2 to 4 times higher miner centralization on BCH. For example if you count all the Bitmain proxies, you'll get about 40% dominance on Bitcoin and 80% dominance on BCH. This is dramatic.  \nNow, there are social factors to consider here, for example Bitmain created BCH to still be able to use covert ASICBOOST, so no surprise here. However BCH blocks are empty, so this line of your argument is not only incorrect, but also irrelevant.  \n\nFrom another point of view, the BCH has only a couple of people running fullnodes. It, of course also cannot be argued for smaller blocks, because it turned out this way due to social issues. We know this, because, again: BCH blocks are empty.  \nBCH: https://twitter.com/SondreB/status/943690490523856897  \nBTC: https://twitter.com/SondreB/status/943690490523856897  \n\nThe difference is staggering.  \n\nA couple of other points:  \n\nWe are arguing as scaling would mean 100MB, while it is extremely small, 1.6GB may be enough for a large metro area (https://i.imgur.com/aI7HuXW.png).  \n\n**PRIVACY.** Ironically the conversation never gets this far, but a huge problem with big blocks is private transaction retrieval. The main problem is: if you ask somebody: \"hey what are the balances of these Bitcoin addresses?\" well, you've just exposed to a third party what Bitcoin addresses you have, how much money you have, etc...  \nFor this, Mike Hearn implemented bloom filters, which turned out to be a huge catastrophe from a privacy point of view: https://jonasnick.github.io/blog/2015/02/12/privacy-in-bitcoinj/  \n\nThe only other method that exist today in its infancy is full block downloading SPV wallets (HiddenWallet, Breeze Wallet, Jonas Schnelli's PR to Core) still downloads the whole Blockchain from the creation of the wallet, so that's no fun, either.

Over the course of time, I have not seen anyone saying that blocksize has contributed to miner centralization.  Anyone seriously discussing mining centralization in the real world (rather than in theory) has talked about the things I listed: manufacturing/engineering, electricity, etc.  As for real evidence, just look at a [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=bitcoin+mining+centralization&oq=bitcoin+mining+centralization).  Everyone (I'm using that term somewhat loosely, but you get the point) talking about real, existing centralization is not saying that it's due to block sizes, but instead about the location of ASIC manufacturers, cheap, hydroelectric power, cold weather, cheap labor, etc.  Everyone talking about centralization risk due to blocksize growth is speaking theoretically.  Meanwhile, block sizes have grown by an order of magnitude since 2012 or two orders of magnitude since 2011.

Each miner can essentially create their own fee schedule and modify it as they see fit.  If they are smart, and I think they are, they would adapt to changes in the block reward by raising minimum acceptable fees.  They don't need a blocksize cap in order to do that.  You may worry that a different miner can force huge blocks with low fees on a miner who would prefer to charge more for those blocks for whatever reason, but that is the nature of competition.  We have created real, functioning markets for digital goods which would not be scarce if it were not for restrictions on supply set by their producers/owners.

Everyone (I'm using that term somewhat loosely, but you get the point) talking about real, existing centralization is not saying that it's due to block sizes, but instead about the location of ASIC manufacturers, cheap, hydroelectric power, cold weather, cheap labor, etc. Everyone talking about centralization risk due to blocksize growth is speaking theoretically.

There is literally no way for anyone to force you to route payments through them.\n\n>The promise of low fees seems questionable under such circumstances.\n\nThe promise of low fees comes from the fact that it will be cheap to run a node, and payments can be routed through the cheapest path. Anyone charging too much will be blacklisted on the network.

Adoption might take time (fees will still be high for the early adopters to open channels).\n\nAdopting LN and fixing on-chain congestion are not mutually exclusive.\n\n>This assumes LN will only handle existing demand for transactions, and not create new demand.\n\nYour argument is circular. You're effectively saying that LN doesn't address congestion because if it's successful more people will flock to bitcoin and therefore there will be more congestion. LN increases *throughput* (i.e. how many transactions can be done). Regardless of demand, increased throughput is good.\n\nOther scaling will be needed along with LN, but the different scaling options work together (e.g. segwit adoption increases on-chain transaction volume, and LN gets some of that volume off chain.\n\nIf LN is used as designed - e.g. regular users putting spending money in a channel and then using those funds indefinitely for all their transactions (perhaps with an occasional top-up from their cold storage wallet), then new users will rarely be contributing to the on-block transactions.\n\n>new users buying bitcoins for the first time, or closing their account, which I would guess is a lot of the congestion right now.\n\nMost of bitcoin usage is to and from exchanges. If the 80% figure is close to accurate, all exchanges switching to LN would effectively move the bulk of that 80% of transactions off the blockchain.

Either the block size increases as much as it needs to or everyone will abandon bitcoin for an alternative. LN is useless if the underlying blockchain remains crippled.

This is absolutely a good thing, as it keeps the network healthy.\n\n>hopefully I could cheaply switch hubs \n\nAll that is needed is a healthy ecosystem of hubs. Since hubs can generate income (and are pretty cheap to run in the first place), it's safe to assume that this will be the case, and there will always be multiple routes for any payment. Good wallets should automatically route the cheapest way. There should be no reason to manually switch or choose payment routes (maybe in the early days).\n\nWith the advantages of Moore's Law, it might even be possible for people to run LN nodes on their phones in future.\n\n>It should be obvious that you need at least one of the following:\n>Many channels (a case which you discarded as unreasonable in your last post)\n\nI really don't think you understand LN. Why would you need 'many channels'? If the network is robust, most people would need at most a small number of channels. I only have 1 connection to the Internet, but I can somehow magically access every single website in the world. If I needed a separate ISP for every website I frequent I might as well not bother.\n\n>A third party\n\nWhere are you getting the idea of a 3rd party from? There are no 3rd parties in LN. In the unlikely event that you don't have a route to someone else on the network (effectively impossible if the network is not a complete failure), you can simply open a direct channel to that party. This may occasionally be the case in the early days, but if the network gains any proper scale, most people would get by with 1 or 2 channels.\n\nAre you describing LN nodes as 3rd parties? If so, that's disingenuous. Nodes simply relay transactions around the network. They don't have access to your coin nor have a say in the transaction you're making. They do not need to be trusted.\n\n> It may or may not result in less congestion.\n\nReducing the number of on-chain transactions per person helps congestion. You can't claim that if other factors re-introduce congestion LN has failed. Lack of other scaling isn't a fault of LN (which is what you're implying whether deliberately or not); it's a fault of the whole scaling strategy, of which LN is one part.\n\n\n-------------\n\nIf bitcoin fails to scale for whatever reason (e.g. block size stubbornness), another coin will take the best parts and improve the worst. There will be a coin with great scaling and instant, cheap transactions happening 'off chain' in the forseable future. Whether that is bitcoin or not doesn't matter in the slightest. It would probably be better if it wasn't, actually (since bitcoin already has an 'unfair' distribution to early adopters).", 1], ["2017-12-31 14:02:59", "In the middle ages knights would ride horses; the complex coconut cycle is a myth.", 1], ["2017-12-31 23:55:41", "> It was implied by your comment\n\nMaybe you should re-read my post.

I don't think users must always do it.\n\n> If bitcoin fees/congestion aren't solved in the near future, and solved pretty definitively, bitcoin will (rightly) die.\n\nI'm not sure if it would necessarily die, or just become more restricted.  It could still be used by the wealthy to dodge inflation.  Gold does that too, but it still has an increasing supply, so all other things being equal, for a certain size of deposit, the returns from Bitcoin could overtake it on average, despite fees.  So long as Bitcoin has the highest market cap / the perception of being the least easy cryptocurrency to manipulate, it could retain this use case.\n\nMaybe financial institutions could also use it; they move large amounts of money at once, can afford the fees, and are interested in avoiding regulations, and presumably inflation too.  But I don't know enough about that industry to know whether it is truly useful to them or not.\n\nAnd in general, the distribution of wealth in the world means that Bitcoin could still potentially hold a lot of value even if it is only interesting to the most wealthy.  Although for both these cases, I would question whether or not volatility pretty much ruins everything.  Different entities have different risk-reward assessments though (and to some, the collapse of fiat is a bigger risk than Bitcoin volatility).  \n\n> Are you describing LN nodes as 3rd parties? If so, that's disingenuous.\n\n\"Third party\" (quality of routing service) and \"trusted third party\" (security) are not the same thing.  When I use ssh, it goes through my ISP, but I do not trust my ISP, I trust the cert on my machine.  My ISP still charges me unpredictable fees for a low-reliability service, because they have a monopoly.  They have a monopoly because of some politics and the underlying shared infrastructure, or whatever else happens with utilities.  \n\nSimilarly, it seems beneficial to LN users to ensure that no single hub can provide most of the routing while getting away with similar practices.\n\n> Reducing the number of on-chain transactions per person helps congestion.\n\nTo demonstrate that this is an over-generalization, I can provide an explicit counterexample.  WLOG, suppose the block fits exactly 1 000 on-chain transactions, regardless of type.  Suppose the demand curve has 1 000 transactions willing to pay $1 fees, and 1 000 users with 100 transactions each, willing to pay $.1 fees per transaction.  Adding LN to the picture would result in the block filling with 1 000 $10 fee channel openings (other LN-related on-chain transactions are ignored for the sake of simplicity).  The small transactions, which Bitcoin was previously unusable for, would raise the minimum fee to get into a block.\n\nThis example is not supposed to be realistic or representative.  There are also clearly examples where it lowers on-chain fees.  I just don't think you can generalize a complex system the way you are doing it.", 1], ["2017-12-31 16:40:26", "> complex coconut cycle\n\nOh man, that's deep.

It doesn't take many businesses/individuals running nodes to have enough of a network to keep downward pressure on fees. LN nodes can't really do anything other than set high fees, which would ensure nobody uses them. There is no incentive to charge high fees. Large hubs would be nothing like a monopoly, as they have no control over whether you route through them, and there will always be alternate paths (unless the network is so weak it's a moot point anyway).\n\nI can't even think of an exaggerated scenario in which my only route to pay someone requires that I go through a particular hub. If the network was that weak it would be useless anyway. Unlike mining, big businesses have no advantage when running a node.\n\n>This example is not supposed to be realistic or representative. \n\nIt stops before the benefit of LN is shown. After the users in your example open their channels they will no longer need to make on-chain transactions. Any transactions they would have made will now be on LN. Those transactions to open an LN channel are effectively one-off, so any congestion caused by a rush of users opening channels will be temporary.\n\nSuddenly, all those people who were regularly transacting on the blockchain are now on LN, paying and receiving without their transactions hitting the blockchain. Block space is less scarce, so fees drop. Whichever way you spin it, LN increases throughput because there is literally no reason to use LN unless you intend to make multiple transactions on LN that would otherwise need the blockchain.\n\nLN would no doubt increase the number of transactions people do (after all, it's impractical to use the blockchain to do anything other than transfer large amounts now, and people want to spend bitcoin as a currency), but that's separate from LN's ability to increase throughput.\n\n-------------\n\nYou're arguing as if someone is claiming that LN definitively solves all the current scaling issues. LN radically increases throughput, which has an obvious benefit for reducing congestion. It's not the only change needed to make bitcoin work again. Bitcoin is currently bottlenecked. LN's big benefit is that it dramatically increases the effect of any other scaling - it isn't a replacement for them.\n ", 1]]}, "299": {"created": "2017-12-28 12:26:52", "title": "A quick question relating to hash functions", "num_comments": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "score": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-12-28 21:03:10", "I think what you want to look into is [Public-key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), and you can follow the link on [Digital Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) to that article as well.

I am really curious about this myself.  Completely empty blocks could be explained by SPV mining strategy, but I don't know about mostly-empty blocks.  It's not inconceivable that it's part of some pricing strategy leveraging the size of the mining pool where, for some percent of randomly chosen blocks, ignoring transactions below a certain fee encourages some people to pay a premium for the certainty of not being delayed, above what they would have to pay for reasonable certainty of inclusion in always-full blocks.  Suppose N people are willing to pay X for a 90%+ chance of confirmation in the next block, and a pool has 20% of hashpower.  Then if N and X are large enough, probabilistically setting 50% of blocks aside for fees of X or more only would lead to greater profits.  But I don't know if this is what's actually happening.\n2. This is how mining pools work.\n3. It seems this could lead to uncontrolled inflation.  Maybe it would also encourage mining centralization because there would be an added, direct incentive to gain more hashpower, even if you control a large share of hashpower already, compared to the current system where only your share of hashpower affects income (diminishing returns).", 2], ["2017-09-30 16:13:54", "> Why is the block linked so small compared to three blocks higher? \n\nMiners are free to include as few or many transactions in the block as they wish (up to the size limit). There are vaguely legitimate reasons to mine an empty block. For example, if you find a new block straight after the previous block is received, you haven't had a chance to validate the block and remove the transactions in that block from your mempool so you can build your own valid block. There are also illegitimate reasons - see asicboost. \n\n\n\n> If the fastest person to mine the block is the only person to get rewards, why are they being handed almost $40k? Wouldn't it make sense for that to be broken down into tiers and then handed out to other top miners? Or even randomized? What does this type of reward system promote?\n\nShort answer to your question : it promotes competition between the miners. Honest competition is thought to be a good way to keep everyone \"honest\". \n\n> If difficulty scales, do rewards scale as well? If not, why?\n\nRewards scales as bitcoin increases in price.

When a web server has the private keys to bitcoin accounts and can send those bitcoins to users, the wallet is known as a Hot Wallet. Even if a number of people are given exclusive privileges to withdraw funds, any single person who gains admin access to the server can also steal these coins (admin, hacker, website coder, janitor near the actual server hardware, etc.). As such, the bitcoin balance for hot wallets are kept low to minimize the damage in case of a theft. The downside is that Hot Wallets need to be monitored -- if they run low, the company needs to fund the hot wallets again, if they go too high, the company can minimize risk by moving bitcoins to wallets that the server doesn't have access to.\n\n**Improve Security with Multisig.** Companies with large bitcoin holdings keep most of them in Cold Storage wallets ([wallets where private keys are stored offline](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Cold_storage)). Typically, these wallets are secured by m-of-n multisig, which locks a bitcoin address with n private keys and requires at least m of those n keys to spend the stored coins. \n\n**Caveats.** No design is perfect. Allowing your users to have quick access to withdraw their bitcoins makes hot wallets necessary, even though hot wallets are an inherent risk. We can learn a lot about how modern companies secure their bitcoins from [last year's hack of Bitfinex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack). In their case, Bitfinex used 2-of-3 multisig to protect their heavily funded hot wallets. Bitfinex's withdrawal servers held one key and BitGo, a Blockchain security company, held the second key (Bitfinex presumably kept the third key super secret in case it needed to withdraw all bitcoins without BitGo's help). When a user wanted to withdraw bitcoins, both Bitfinex and BitGo had to sign a bitcoin transaction.\n\nUnfortunately, a hacker gained access to Bitfinex's servers and either knew or discovered that the same server that had Bitfinex's private key was also responsible for telling BitGo about user withdrawals. This allowed the hacker to fake a withdrawal request to <hacker's bitcoin address> so that BitGo would sign with their key. The hacker signed with Bitfinex's key and suddenly Bitfinex's $72 million hot wallet was drained, even though they used multisig.\n\n**Lessons.** I think there are two major lessons: Securing hot wallets is incredibly difficult and a good system shouldn't have a single point of failure.", 2]]}, "334": {"created": "2017-04-07 18:31:21", "title": "Original BIP Proposal Outlining Response to Potential Covert ASICBOOST", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "335": {"created": "2017-03-29 16:37:04", "title": "Bitcoin - Emergent Consensus", "num_comments": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-03-30 00:39:59", "This is an implementation that I could imagine gaining steam in the near future, if executed well.\n\nI imagine there is a not-insignificant number of users who favor both segwit and bigger blocks.\n\nAlso, if BU continues to have bug issues affecting its nodes, I could see alternative implementations of emergent consensus starting to look more appealing.", 3], ["2017-04-14 19:04:11", "I think there are two quite different interpretations of Emergent Consensus. \n\nOne is out-of-band agreement, which is pretty ultimately what the status quo ante was, except that you have to compile your own software if you don't like the defaults in Core.

The deduction is fascinating and also rich with insight or corollary to other interesting topics or history events.\n\nThe exchange rate between two moneys is the ratio of their real term price.

The reason is that the price of a money (in real term) is also serving the cost to start an attack or the cost of trust (if I am willing to commit more than the energy presented by 1.0 coin to attack you, you would be attacked by me for something we value it worth 1.0 coin, or, if Bob gives Alice a wedding ring worth 1.0 coin, Alice can trust Bob to a degree represented by that amount of energy).

Say, I use my 4096-bit pgp private key to author a message \"I will give you 100 USD tomorrow\" and encrypt it with your 4096-bit pgp public key, do you think this commitment is with high security or else?  To me, it is not defining the security that the digital message is so secured that no one can fake the message, what my definition of security is about the economic commitment.  Or better, maybe a prefix to the word \"security\" such as crypto-security, econ-security.  Then, crypo-security may be currently enough but easily out of date (remembering the fate of md5, sha1, more efficient sha256 mining rig, the hash was enough but is not enough or the hash is increasing but requires the same amount of energy for operation) while econ-security is more prevailing. \n\n> By this author's analogy, Paypal dollar should be valued less than paper dollar.\n\nIt is.

Your \"unit of security\" or \"cost of security\" looks like the number on the numerator in some of your statement.  When we try to compare two coin's security, we shall focus on 1.0 coin; 1E10 LTC is higher \"cost of security\" than 1 BTC, but I believe you (me too) will say \"BTC is more secured than LTC\" instead.

For argument purpose (though looks silly), imagine you need to write a note to your sister when she escrows the USD cash to you.  This note is a private coin you invent.  Another guy doing the same thing for someone else is inventing another private coin.

If they do resemble USD cash with k=1 successfully, they have the same econ-security (regardless different K' numerator): the same energy amount to attack/establish a commitment represented by USD cash one dollar.\n\nBtw, you may feel odd about describing value in energy term.  If you read on those links, you will know what I call \"purchasing power axiom\" that \"a sound money shall be able to pay the same amount to heat water in a remote past and future\".  Knowing that it does cost the same amount of energy to heat the water in a remote past and future by middle school physics, the real term value of a money is best described by the exchange rate COIN/Joule.  When this number doubles, your holding of the coin really doubles the wealth in real term.

There's just no way to cancel a transaction without spending the utxo(s) that were its inputs, which means paying for fees, so you might as well just use RBF to get the original transaction through.\n\nExactally, but this assumes that miners are not working for secondary incentives.  I'm simply saying that should be something that is relied upon.  There is a risk period between the time a TXN is sent and a time that a TXN is confirmed.  In that risk period, the sender has no way to garantee the TXN will get confirmed no matter what fee they pay.  Having a script+locktime change, as you propose, would give the sender a way to mitigate that risk and know that a TXN was voided and its UTXOs are now safe again, without having to go to the network which just throws them back in the same risk pool they were trying to mitigate.\n\nFrom the BIP\n\n>This consensus soft fork would introduce a new OP code OP_TBD replacing OP_NOP4.

And there's no banks to run on in bitcoin", 3], ["2017-12-14 21:42:58", "The problem with typical deflation is that there is not enough money around to actually represent the amount of wealth, so we quite literally run out of money available to buy basic things like bread. \n\nThe economy is like a pie. There's a certain amount of \"wealth/value\" in the world represented by the pie. This pie is magic though. It can actually grow and shrink proportionally based on decisions and actions we make. \n\nLet's say you have a bunch of raw building materials. Those materials have a certain level of demand for them, and thus they are valuable. They have potential to do something even more useful. If I buy those materials, and build a house out of them, I have consumed that potential (cut boards to lengths that may not work for other projects), but I have arguably created more value for the world. A house is more useful to more people than raw building supplies. My actions have thus taken a small amount of wealth from the pie and replaced it with a larger amount. What if I built that house in Antarctica though? Where no one wants to live? Well now I have removed resources and their potential to do good, and built a house that no one will ever live in with them, effectively a net destruction of value. It can certainly be said I am destroying value if instead of building the house I throw those supplies into the ocean. \n\nSo with the idea that the size of the pie can grow and contract based on our decisions/actions, we need to understand where money fits into that equation. Money is effectively a way to temporarily store value in a way that makes it easy for me to communicate value to you. Essentially, it's a way of saying \"hey, I created value doing one task, and now I would like to give you some level of value because I want to consume what you have created.\" Effectively, money is a representation of a slice of the pie. The more money you have, the more of the pie you have in your control. \n\nThe problem with traditional money is, as people are regularly more productive but the money supply stays the same, the slices get bigger and bigger, but the number of slices stays the same. Eventually, a single slice may represent so much value, that you don't want to trade it for something like a loaf of bread. The problem is exasperated, when deflation is so severe, that you hold onto it. Why buy 1 loaf today when it can be worth 2 tomorrow? This effectively reduces the number of slices in the pie, making the slices even bigger. This can run out of control easily.\n\nThis is also exasperated when credit is seen as money, but it isn't. It's an IOU for money in the future based on valuable activities. If I destroy wealth with credit I am given (take a loan out for strippers and blow), that promise for future return of value breaks down, and that debt must be written off. It was previously treated just like money on the balance sheet of the bank, and they were banking on me paying it back to fulfill their obligations. If I fail to pay it back, they risk failing their obligations, which makes even more \"money\" disappear from the economy. This happens in a cascading effect like what we saw in 2008. As people couldn't actually pay their home loans, they defaulted and the banks then were going to default. Instead of letting them collapse for their malinvestment, the country simply took out another loan (credit/IOUs) and gave it to the banks to balance their books. In effect, the country just sold your future labor in the form of higher income taxes later, to cover the losses of gambling bankers. When the government can't collect the income tax to cover these loans, they will take out more loans and print more money, ultimately penalizing those holding the money. They are taking your slice of pie that you worked for, and cutting it in half to give it to the guy who just had a slice and threw it in the trash. That should infuriate you. \n\nThe solution to this, has been to try and grown the money supply proportionally to the growth of the pie. If we can make the number of slices grow, proportionally to the amount the economy is growing, no one should be able to detect the size of individual slices changing. \n\nThe reason this doesn't apply to bitcoin, is because it doesn't have the same limitation all other currencies do, with respect to how far a slice can actually be subdivided. Until now, the whole number side has always been infinitely unconstrained, because we can only represent $.01 with a penny. There literally isn't a smaller denomination. So instead of the economy growing to where a penny would represent the same amount of value as a car, we release that pressure by essentially devaluing it. With bitcoin, it doesn't need to actually get devalued to represent any amount of value, no matter how small. Because the 21M coins represents the entire pie, but they are infinitely divisible, you could represent any amount of value as a certain portion of the overall supply. Prices simply reflect the amount of money in circulation. So if the same amount of money stays in circulation, prices simply continue to fall. But we don't run into the penny problem, because being entirely digital, there's no problem with the physical representation of the money. And we can independently verify that the amount being received is a valid amount of the overall pie. Sure this also has the reflection of people holding onto the coins rather than spending, and that will affect prices, but as prices lower, they will spend those coins and they are reintroduced to the supply. It may take a while for this volatility in prices to calm, but it eventually will. People have necessities. Having more buying power tomorrow doesn't help me if I'm dying of thirst or hunger today. A bitcoin based economy wouldn't have such rabid consumerism as we have today, but I would argue that is for the best both psychologically for our species, and for the planet as a whole (consumerism is by far the largest energy driver and raw material exploitation driver).\n\nWhat would happen if there was only 1 bitcoin, and everyone simply had a portion of that?

Much like if you try to explain to someone 100 years ago who has never seen or used a motorcycle (or any engine-driven transportation) before, exactly what a motorcycle  is when they've only ever walked, ridden horses, or rode a bike.  Because how do you explain that?  You can say \"it's a form of transportation\".  And they will say, but I can already walk or ride a bike.  You say this is like riding a bike, but faster.  And they will say thats why they own a horse to go farther for longer.  And you'll say, yes but a horse has some drawbacks, like it's a living thing you need to keep alive, and you need to feed it, and it leaves shit all over the roads that's smelly and a health hazard.  And they'll ask if a motorcycle does that, and you'd say no.  It's like a bike with an engine.  So it just needs gas and regular maintenance.  Then they'll ask what an engine is (because they don't know what that is either) and also what is gas?    Then they will ask if this will replace bikes and horses and walking completely, and you'll say not completely, but it will find a place as a mode a transportation among the others, as each have relative advantages and disadvantages.\n\nAnd you see then why to give them a good explanation of what bitcoin is, compared to other existing forms of money, requires a greater understanding of other things and a more complete explanation to give them a better understanding that can't really be done with just a simple analogy.  So, like saying a motorcycle is like a form of transportation like a horse or bicycle is fine for a basic understanding that \"it's a form of transportation\", to a person who doesn't really know what an engine is or have seen it used before, it's hard to give a full understanding of what it is and why it has advantages and disadvantages over the others.  \n\nOk maybe that was long winded.

And this is true to some degree or another in every country. Ending that seigniorage theft would help a lot of people. Not only that but many believe the market manipulation, that the Fed uses its created money for, introduces inefficiencies in the market and even exacerbates the business cycle and lengthens recessions. If we can reduce recessions by removing governments' ability to manipulate the market in harmful ways, that improves everyone's lives as well.\n\nOn the more individual level, a currency without inflation makes it easier to save money. This in turn would reduce the need for so much debt and people could be individually more self sufficient. All fiat money out there is someone's debt. \n\nAlso there are cool things you can do with programmable money, but most of it boils down to a cheaper way to send money than what we have currently.

For example:\n\nCarol opens a channel at the coffee shop, then opens another channel at the shoe store.  Unfortunately they are owned by the same parent company, who can now link her bitcoin addresses together because the same node has been observed to control both channels.  Even if this doesn't necessarily prove anything in particular (assuming the channels themselves don't leak any information), as Carol's node could just be relaying payments from two other nodes, unless Carol is a large hub operator, the anonymity set is pretty small.  Querying Carol about her routing fees to various destinations (and that is just one way) would probably leak information about her approximate place on the connectivity graph and therefore approximately what the anonymity set is.  \n\n> I believe that the way routing is being worked on, Bob wouldn't even know if Alice was sending money to Carol.\n\nInteresting.  I can see in general how this could work with some nested encryption scheme, although my knowledge is far too poor to think through all the details.  \n\nDoes LN currently do it this way, or is it just a theoretical possibility for payment channels in the future?", 1], ["2017-11-09 09:44:52", "The cost/benefit of extra nodes for extra anonymity seems like a really bad deal in LN, so I have a hard time imagining the scenario you're describing really being worth it.\n\nThe cost is more channel openings and closures, which, being more complicated smart contracts, will add up to more fees in a non negligible way. Also, it would require someone to lock up far more of their funds, and therefore have a lower limit on what you could send in a single transaction. \n\nAnd the same time, the benefit is really small. The nodes and connections aren't publicly visible in LN and most transactions never hit the blockchain, so privacy is pretty high. And as I said before, peers only glean information from you if you send them money directly, or you rerouted a payment through them (which still gives virtually no information about you as an individual).\n\nSo what you're describing is almost certainly unnecessary, and comes at a high cost. That being said, I agree with you that it could be done, if a special need arose.\n\nAs for how routing currently works... I don't know, I'm not that up to date.

You don't have to explain what the philosophers stone is, you're posting on the internet - just link it.

In fact the perpetuum mobile is neither relevant to your topic nor relevant to the philosopher's stone. It's not why your readers are there.\n\nSecond, say something about the topic first. Move the 4th paragraph to the start and mix in some sentences from the 3rd paragraph into the rest of the article. You could say something like \"Just like people dreamed of inventing a philosopher's stone to turn lead permanently to gold, people today are in search of a stable coin that can turn bits to digital gold and keep them that way.\"\n\nThe rest of the content of that 3rd paragraph doesn't add much.

Someone who is familiar with Chaum's work would read the whitepaper as \"Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic Cash System\" because that's what separates it as an innovation from what preceded it.\n\n\nThe (over)emphasis on the word \"cash\" in the Bitcoin whitepaper's subtitle is generally performed by people who are not well-versed in cryptography and/or want to make it seem like Satoshi would somehow disapprove of Bitcoin being saved or treated as an investment. On the contrary, Satoshi explicitly said that he modeled Bitcoin's inflation/mining-schedule on gold mining in the Bitcoin whitepaper itself:\n\n>The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\n\nThis was not the only time [he likened Bitcoin to gold](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583.msg11405#msg11405), either.

It's a must-read, in my opinion.\n\nIf you're *still* looking for something to reinforce the OP's point here, another must-read is Krawisz's legendary [I\u2019m Hoarding Bitcoins, and No You Can\u2019t Have Any](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/im-hoarding-bitcoins-and-no-you-cant-have-any/) piece.\n\n**Sound money** is Bitcoin's (first) killer app. The rest comes later, and on top of that foundation.", 8], ["2018-03-12 21:39:14", "> The value of a currency comes from it being held.\n\nThis is what is sometimes called [Velocity Of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money).\n\nThe funny thing is that the faster the transactions are, the less market cap is needed to facilitate transactions.

In practice I'm pretty sure the costs of doing this will mean that actually people will want to hold a balance at any one time in order to allow them to make transactions at will - as they do with traditional currencies.  Also note that with LN people will need to hold relatively large amounts in channel funding.  Either way I think people will always want to hold bitcoin to facilitate transactions (as long as it is useful for that).  \n\nNote this desire to hold balances for facilitating future transactions is almost exclusively what determines demand for fiat currencies - as they are, by deliberate design, a poor store of value.\n\nActually I'd go further and say that, in the end, the only thing real under here is the value for transactions.  That's bitcoin's \"intrinsic value\", if you will.  In my view the expectation that it would be useful for transactions is what bootstrapped bitcoin into having value in the first place.

It's a shift in perspective which in the case of bitcoin doesn't mean much at a macrolevel since, as you pointed out, everything goes hand-in-hand. However, in the case of a lot of altcoins, most of the holding behaviour is solely for facilitating transactions. While most ERC20 tokens don't come out and say it, a vast majority of them derive their valuations based on an ease of transfer with minimal or no holding behaviour (e.g. for social media, or apps, or in one case; dentistry [lol dentacoin]), the liquidity between ethereum/bitcoin and these tokens will be so great in the future (i.e. immediate transfer between tokens with no counterparty risk using smart contracts) that even a heavy user would hold no more than $20 in their app currency wallet (and who the hell would hold any money in a dental coin wallet?).

What you're seeing is actually the effect of scaling because the bigger bus delivered all the passengers to their destination hence there was no backlog to make the bigger bus full. You're seeing the smaller bus mostly fully packed with passengers because the capacity is so limited, the bus terminal (mempool) is always full of people waiting to get on the next bus. In other words, the bigger bus with less passengers is because of better scaling as it always clear the mempool of transactions. What happens when the bus is always full? Then people have to bid for space on the next bus, which is why when mempool is jammed, the transaction fee goes up (not sure if you realize that).

The dollar can temporarily become a crypto, as a bittoken, during the transaction process, and revert back to the dollar once the transaction is complete.

Transparency is vital to prevent money laundering, tax evasion and other illicit activities. As long as bitcoin was a minor part of the economy, governments looked the other way. But when the bitcoin bubble started and evetually burst, governments and banks around the world have swung into action and have clamped down hard - more regulations are on the way. Several prominent banks like Citigroup, JP Morgan and Lloyds have now even banned buying of crypto currency with credit cards.\n\nThese are still early days and only time will tell what is the true future of crypto currency.
