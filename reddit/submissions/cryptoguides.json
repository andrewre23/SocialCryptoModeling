Value is just what we say it is.", 1], ["2017-09-27 22:22:55", "It's not really a question about the philosophy of money.  Money does have intrinsic value in the sense that it's a convenience.  You don't have to haul around gold bars all day, and that's worth something.  USD is also *somewhat* secure in ways that material value isn't.  It's also backed by one of the worlds largest governments.  None of that is \"because people say it has value\".\n\nWith crypto, you can get the added value of:\n\n1) a secure decentralized public ledger\n\n2) anonymity\n\n3) trustless transactions\n\nand much more.  It seems that with GRC you don't really benefit from any of these since it's not a good coin to transact in, store value in, or speculate on since there actually is no intrinsic value.  It's not a resource, you can't *do* anything with it besides send it around, and even sending it around isn't as valuable as something like an ERC20 token since the blockchain it's on isn't nearly as secure as Ethereum's.\n\nMost coins will pay dividends, allow for governance, behave as a platform-specific currency or resource, or have some other *useful* aspect.  GRC seems like it's just Dogecoin but without the memes or community behind it.  Speculating on it's value as an investment would be pure gambling, and buying it out of passion is simply dumb from a financial point of view since there's no expectation of the value going up since there's no value to begin with.", 1], ["2017-09-28 05:43:14", "Well there is proof of research involved with Gridcoin. It basically supports science by using BOINC. Proof of Research proves that you did a certain amount of work with BOINC. BOINC helps scientist and mathematicians.

There is simply too much breadth and depth to cover, and you end up sacrificing so much when trying to make it simple that you end up not really explaining anything close to what crypto really is.\n\nMy recommendation is to take it in small chunks.

Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places, so you can buy .00000001 BTC if you want (approximately $0.00006).  The smallest denomination of a Bitcoin is called a Satoshi, and you can see the current value of a Satoshi at https://99bitcoins.com/satoshi-usd-converter/.\n\nNow, there may be minimum limits depending on where you buy from, but it's totally reasonable to buy just a few dollars of Bitcoin.\n\nThe transaction fees of Bitcoin are higher than other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin though, so you may end up paying more in fees than the amount your sending is worth if it's under $5 or so.", 2], ["2017-10-25 00:32:42", "Feel free to ask me any question, and if you want to get input on Ethereum in particularly, the /r/Ethereumnoobies sub is a good place to post/read.", 1], ["2017-10-25 00:35:34", "So let's say hypothetically, I put in $500 (my best) next month out of my paycheck to bitcoin.

If you bought $500 at a price lower than it is today ($6k), lets say at $5k, then you would get .1 BTC.  If BTC somehow hits 20k, you would 4x your investment and have 2k (if you just held).  \n\nI think Ethereum has much more potential for several reasons, and thus much more price increase potential.  \n\n", 1], ["2017-10-25 00:43:18", "Understanding blockchain will help you understand both Bitcoin and Ethereum (as well as pretty much all other cryptos), so I'd start there.
