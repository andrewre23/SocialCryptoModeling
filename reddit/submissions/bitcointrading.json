It is very difficult to trade especiailly if you are new to trading. So just HODL. If you believe in blockchain technology than just HODL, as the price should rise as more and more people appreciate the technology and see the benefits of it. I am a massive believer of blockchain techonology so I am HODLING!!\n\n\nTrading\nThe strategy I am using to trade, during this crashes, is to sell when crashing and buy back at a cheaper price to own more bitcoin. Again this is risky. In the past I've lost money with bitcoin cash, TRON but made a lot of money when trading with XLM, XRP etc.\n\nMy suggestion is only trade if you have the following skills / experience:\n\n    Day trading experience of other commodities (Technical analysis)\n    Banking / Financial Industry Experience (Fundamental analysis)\n    Understand Cryptocurrency and Blockchain\n    Up to date with all Crypto News\n    Controlling Emotions\n\nConclusion\n\nI am a HODLER. I hold most of my portfolio. I have done day trading in the past so have good experience of technical analysis. I enjoy trading so do trade when I have time and see good opportunities in the market. However, I do not trade and risk more than 25% of my portfolio\n\nPlease comment below I am curious to hear your opinion on these strategies and strategies that you use to make $$$?\n\nIf you enjoyed this article / video please Upvote, Share and Subscribe.\n\nThanks for your time\n", 1], ["2018-02-23 16:50:35", "Everytime i tried to trade, i lost money.
