They handle all the transactions associated with your wallet. That's okay if you're new and just dipping your feet in the water. However, this means that if coinbase were subject to a malicious attack, ie some hacker had access to an employee's computer or something, then chances are your ETH would be gone. This is why the article suggests creating your own wallet, in which you manage the private key, and thus transactions from the wallet are controlled *only by you*. But until (if ever) coinbase gets hacked, you can create your own wallet, then go on coinbase and use their interface to send ETH from your coinbase account to your newly created wallet.", 11], ["2017-05-16 01:36:41", "A wallet is nothing more than one or more private keys (and other useful stuff).

How does this system of computers that \u201crun ETH\u201d work exactly? Do these folks have any kind of special access? Who is allowed to run it, exactly? Can anyones coins be compromised by these individuals running these computers?\n\n3.What does mining a coin entail? Can anyone mine a coin? How do you mine ETH?\n\n4. When can you buy ETH or other coins? Is trading open at all times or only certain times like the stock market?\n\n5. Is there a minimum amount that needs to be traded before that price will register as the \u201clast traded price\u201d? For example, stocks below a certain value have to trade a min of 100 shares otherwise that price it trades at wont register as the \u201clast traded price\u201d\n\n\n6. What are the values of these coins based off of? Is there any value besides speculation? \n\n7. Can an entity invest in these coins or only individuals? \n\n\n8. Can you buy fractional shares?\n\n\n9.You mention getting a new seperate email for ETH related stuff...can you sync it with your smart phone or no?\n\n\n10. Are there transaction fees?\n\n\n11.

I disagree with many of them at face value, but you could argue that they are better than some alternatives with some context.

Is your audience going to understand this?\n\n> Remember to consult with tax professionals...\n\nIs this warning for users or a disclaimer to protect yourself?  It's totally unnecessary to consult with a CPA, many wont even know what you're talking about.  You **do** need to understand how buying crypto will effect your taxes, so I'd just mention that it's subject to capital gains tax and you need to know what that is/what to do about it.\n\nYour Blockchain and Miners section needs work.  It's not super accurate in terms of how transactions are mined.\n\nYou should specify that the \"0x\" prefix is what indicates hex formatting, since 'x' isn't in A-F, 0-9.  You may also mention that it's case-insensitive.\n\nYou go into a lot of unnecessary topics for beginners like test nets, the EVM, and smart contract code.

I may rephrase the sentence though.\n\nre: tax professionals, this is just to put out a good warning that these are real assets and you are legally responsible for them and the taxes you owe. I would much prefer I recommend tax professionals here, than not.

However, this section can be enhanced. PM me if you have a better re-write.\n\nre: 0x prefix, agreed, I will add in an edit to include the hex prefix concept for my next publish.\n\nre: smart-contracts/test-nets, I wanted this guide to be a little more than just first-time users, I wanted to show people and potential new developers to ethereum what some code looks like and what the networks are currently.

Additionally, make the backup redundant and resilient to attacks where 1 or more pieces are compromised.\n\nSay my private key is ABC, I'd split it up into 3 pieces 'AB', 'BC', and 'CA'.

That means my parents can accidentally throw it out, my house can burn down, or the janitor at work can toss that backup and I'm still okay as long as only 1 happens.\n\nYou can increase redundancy by simply creating more pieces, but I think there's a point where the complexity and potential exposure starts to be pointless and counter-productive.\n\nEdit: some fuckups", 3], ["2017-12-02 06:00:49", "People actually *burned* their printers?", 1], ["2017-12-02 13:53:39", "Thanks, I also always Google and click on the first link.

That is to say, a Nano S is like a key blank that can be cut to match an existing private key (24 words) or a new key with it\u2019s own matching account. \n\nHowever, never at any point will you have a \u2018wallet\u2019 in the sense of a container that holds money.   Even more counterintuitive, is the fact that there are no private accounts and it\u2019s not possible to possess Ether!\n\nETH is public.  Addresses are public.  No individuals *possess* ETH or own addresses because those things exist solely on a public blockchain.   You can't hide them or walk off with them.  You can\u2019t stuff it in a coffee can.   Ultimately, it belongs to everyone.   In a limited sense, Ethereum is like a huge public board that displays the balances of internal resources that can never be removed or possessed by anyone.   \n\nWhat you *can* own is a KEY that gives you the power to move ETH.   *That\u2019s \u201cit\u201d*.\n   \nThis is a *really* important distinction and it reveals just how important it is to protect your key because it's *all you will ever have*.    \n\nGranted,  in the broad sense of ownership, if you have a key to an account with 1000 ETH, the*value* of that *key* is presumably 1000 ETH but never assume that you can *possess* the ETH like you can possess cash or coins or gold.  Nor presume that it\u2019s a bad thing that you can\u2019t.

There's different ways to buy and sell on exchanges, and it doesn't always have to be the highest buy price and lowest sell price.  Limit orders can be set at anything, even amounts that are higher/lower than the highest/lowest buy/sell price.  On GDAX (and most other exchanges), there are things that prevent people from doing this and mistakenly buying at way higher prices (or selling at way lower).  This is the \"post only\" option on GDAX that you can find when doing a limit order under the advanced dropdown.  If you uncheck this, you can post a limit buy/sell at *any* price you want.  This could potentially go \"over\" a buy/sell wall for a worse price.  \n\nThat's obviously not a great idea, and an edge case in terms of normal orders.  Generally, people make sell/buy limit orders at a price at or higher/lower than the existing order edge price (highest/lowset order).  Market orders will \"fill\" these limit orders at the best price, but since these remove liquidity they are charged a fee.  They take liquidity, so they are takers.  Alternatively, limit orders that add liquidity are called makers. \n\nIn your 1000 ETH @ $400 scenario, market orders will fill the limit orders placed at $400 before filling ones at $401.  Still, it's possible to do a limit order at $401 and get a worse buy price if you disable the post only option.  The orders at $400 are filled in a first-come, first-serve FIFO queue.\n\n2) Walls being \"eaten\" usually means being bought/sold away, rather than cancelled.  It's not a formal term though, and orders making up a wall will be canceled if it starts being eaten unless people are FOMOing.\n\nSince it's FIFO, people will often post then cancel then post again so their order remains at the end of the line.  This will prevent their order from being filled (unless the whole thing gets eaten), but keeps the wall looking high and mighty.\n\n3) Since walls can be created by somebody with huge amounts of coin OR created naturally through lots of users just wanting to get in/out at once but there aren't enough sellers/buyers at the time, volume can help determine what's going on.\n\nHigh volume means lots of liquidity, which *should* mean lots of people are trading.  In this case, walls are mostly natural and won't disappear all at once.  Low volume walls could be a sign of whales suppressing the price change, or just a lack of available market orders to fill the limit orders in the wall.\n\nGenerally, high volume indicates high demand (so higher prices).  It could be everyone dumping a coin too though, so it's not a direct indicator of anything.", 1], ["2017-08-28 01:37:00", "In theory a large volume holder could do this, like with any other investment trading structure.

That's really when this community shines, but during bearish markets there are less noobies trying to learn, and less content creators making things for them as a result.\n\nOn one hand, I don't want this sub to be so barren that it essentially only exits when the price is going up.  On the other hand, we should really try to stick to our roots and curate content so that it appeals most to the crypto/Ethereum newcomer.  \n\nIt's also important to remember that this isn't /r/ethtradernoobies.  This isn't a place for newcomers to *learn how to make money*.  It's a place to learn about the technology, applications, and tools surrounding Ethereum.  \n\nThis sub was created to divert content away from /r/Ethereum and /r/EthTrader that wasn't valuable to those readers who already knew everything that had to be said, so a good litmus test for determining which content \"belongs\" here is to see if it belongs in or is valued by those other communities.  A post that lots of people on /r/Ethereum really like may not be quite right for this sub, especially if it requires lots of prerequisite knowledge of the network and ongoing projects. Things like the Golem release, or DGX, or a new 0x relayer - these all really belong more on /r/Ethereum than here IMO. The same applies to posts that are relevant here, most people on /r/Ethereum probably don't care to read how to create a wallet in MEW, talk about how private keys are secure when \"anybody can guess them\", or sort out the difference between gas price and gas limit.\n\nWhat I think this sub does really well is provide a place where people can ask almost any question and get a well-written, accurate, and timely response.  It's not a sub that people probably care to follow forever, just the first few months while they're getting their feet wet in this space, and I think that's perfectly okay! The \"goal\" should be to help people get enough of an understanding to participate in more mature subs like /r/Ethereum, while still being a point of reference any time they stumble across a new and confusing topic.\n\nIf we raise the ceiling to the \"difficulty level\" of our content, we start to encroach on places like /r/ethdev and /r/ethermining.

The risk is that your computer is comprised and a keylogger gets your passphrase when you type it in or someone gets teamview on your computer and has access to it.  Not very likely but it could happen.\n\nFor storing large amounts on MEW you're right cold storage is better.  Generate the key from a computer that hasn't and never will be connected to the internet for maximum safety.  Maybe something like a rasberry PI.\n\nIf you generate keys on your regular computer avoid torrenting, porn, streaming from shady sites etc...\n\nThis is why I like the ledger, everything happens on there so it doesn't matter if your computer is compromised.

To start answering your question, you need to understand some things about wallet management.\n\n\n**Cold Storage**: a wallet that is on an \"air-gapped\", offline system that is intended to store coins for a long period without any withdrawals.\n\n\n**Paper / Offline Wallet**:  a wallet similar to cold storage, but made easier to use through the use of a paper QR code or some other offline tool used to get access to the wallet. \n\n\n**Hot Wallet**:  hot wallets are stored on an online system and used for transfers regularly.  It would be something like keeping your private key in a password manager and using MyEtherWallet.  Jaxx is another sort of hot wallet.\n\n\n**Exchange Wallet**:  exchanges like Coinbase, GDAX, Poloniex, Bittrex, etc own and manage your wallet.  You **do not** have access to the private key of these addresses.\n\n\nThe main thing to understand is that hot/cold/paper wallets are all essentially the same, it's just how the private key is *managed* that is different.  Exchanges are completely different though, since they are the ones in complete control of the address.  \n\n\nPeople often say not to store your funds on an exchange because there are examples of exchanges that have been hacked or compromised in a way that lost people's funds. (Mt. Gox, Shapeshift, Bitfenix, Bitstamp, Bitcoinica, etc...).  If your holding your funds for the long run, an offline wallet is going to be more secure *as long as you manage it correctly.*\n\n\nAs far as ICOs go, many of them are using ERC20 tokens for their coin.  ERC20 compliant tokens run on the Ethereum network, and can be stored in an Ethereum address.  That means you don't need a separate wallet or program to hold these tokens.  ICOs use **smart contracts** to distribute tokens after you invest, and the only way they know who to send tokens to is by sending them back to the addresses where the funds came from.  This means that the address you send Ether or other ERC20 tokens from to an ICO is where you will get your ICO tokens.  **Since you do not control an exchange wallet**, you will not control the ICO tokens sent to one if you transfer from an exchange.  Since exchanges do not support transferring or even seeing the \"alt coins\" in your wallet, they will be stuck there forever.\n\n\nThe guide I posted earlier shows 2 ways using both Parity and MyEtherWallet to participate in ICOs with a bit of an edge, but when you're just using your wallet for regular transfers or smart contracts which aren't extremely time sensitive, you should be setting your gas price as low as possible (4 gwei right now).\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!", 4], ["2017-06-20 22:23:27", "SECTION | CONTENT\n:--|:--\nTitle | MyEtherWallet Tutorial - My Go-to Ethereum Wallet\nDescription | In this video I show how to get and use MyEtherWallet.

My understanding is that they're a way of investing in specific ethereum based projects? \n\nAt the moment I'm just starting to buy some ethereum and am beginning to research the whole crypto area as much as possible.

Anyone with the PK has direct access to the public key / address.  Wallets are simply address managers, and are essentially synonymous with public keys / addresses.  The address is actually just the last part of the public key.\n\nAs far as ICOs, they vary a lot in terms of how the ICO is run, what the tokens are worth, and how they function.\n\nMany ICOs have tokens which are ERC20 compliant, so they can be stored in the same addresses that Ether can be.  This isn't always the case though.  Some ICOs will accept bitcoin, litecoin, or other coins in exchange for an ERC20 token.  Some will accept ERC20 and Ether in exchange for a coin that *isn't* ERC20 and runs on its own blockchain.  When this is the case, you have to have some way of giving them an address where they can send you the tokens in addition to sending funds.\n\nICOs can be anything, don't have to be tied to ETH or any crypto.  The coins get their value depending on how they are used within the project.

PoS favors people who can spend a lot on the coin and lock it up, this provides stability to the price and reduces wastefulness. \n\nIn terms of ICOs, this isn't a super big factor for any of the ones I'm aware of.

I'm sure I will miss some myself, but these are some of the reasons I see.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was first created, it was largely popularized by people interested in the intrinsic Libertarian properties of decentralized currency.  There wasn't a lot of interest in general tokenization, and decentralized computing / smart contracts were not at all what people were thinking of.  The major point was to break away from the governments control over the free market.  Obviously, things like the Silk Road and other anti-government (aka illegal) activities became one of the major use cases for this.\n\nA fundamental difference in crypto now, especially since Ethereum, is that there's a new class of people interested.  This may be why you see such a difference in the Bitcoin and Ethereum camps, Bitcoiners are political ideologists while Ethereum-ers are technical futurists.  Both have their merits and flaws, and there's plenty of overlap, but there's example after example showing this truth.\n\nJust to name one, it's incredibly important that Satoshi Nakamoto never exists.  You can't have a \"leader\" for a political movement defined by individual liberty.  Vitalik on the other hand is exalted for his quirky ultra-geekyness and immense intellectual background.  He's a prodigy, and that's okay with us.  It doesn't detract from the technical implications of Ethereum, and actually helps legitimize the platform on an enterprise level (see the EEA). \n\nAnyway, Bitcoiners are fiercely protective of the fundamental ideology behind their coin.  Much of the 2x debate is not about blockchain size, it's about who is able to determine the future of Bitcoin.  \n\nAs far as the price is concerned, crypto is at a point now where there's a looooot of dumb money around.  People are jumping on and off of the bandwagon based off 5-minute candlesticks.  Many are chasing the \"free\" money from Bitcoin forks, and the general Bitcoin mindset allows for people to get more wrapped up in emotional/philosophical ideals rather than logical/technical side of things.  \n\nThis is *sort of* speculation, but I think anyone who has been around for a few years would agree..  There's a lot of artificial suppressing of Ethereum and other cryptos that pose a threat to Bitcoin's market cap dominance.  If you don't think that Bitcoin whales have an agenda, you're mistaken.  They absolutely do not want other cryptos taking a bite out of Bitcoins growth and price, and are willing to spend billions to stop it.  Luckily for everyone else, this isn't a sustainable fight for them.  Technology will win in the long run, and Bitcoin is not where the technology is at right now.\n\nIf you're truly investing, Ethereum is your safest and best bet.  You might not see returns tomorrow, or a month from now, but you will see returns.\n\nIf you're trading, the fundamentals of coins shouldn't mean much at all.

We first need to understand exactly how Ethereum addresses work and what a wallet does.  \n\nFirstly, Ethereum and all other cryptocurrencies only store funds on the blockchain.  It's very bad rhetoric to say you store funds in a wallet, and it's extremely common for noobies and experienced users to not understand this. \n\nThe one and only way to move funds around on the blockchain is to control the private key (PK).  Your public key (or address) is derived from your private key in a one-way cryptographic function.  You use this proof of ownership of the address to \"sign\" transactions from that address.  On Ethereum, you can do more than just moves X amount of ETH to Y address.  You can interact with smart contracts!  \n\nWallets serve a bunch of functions from simply looking at the blockchain to see how much funds are in an address to letting you interact with complex smart contracts like the ENS.  Generally, they let you view your current balance (of ETH or other ERC20 tokens), sign transactions, and maybe support more complex things like the ENS.  Whatever the case, they are completely built around the fact that the private key is the only thing that matters.\n\nThe Ledger Nano S generates and stores the private key on-device, ensuring that it is protected and no malware or snooping can steal it.  It handles all the transaction signing for you, so it's both safe and convenient.  The drawback is that it's expensive, and it doesn't really solve all security issues entirely.  The Ledger, and many other wallets, uses a seed phrase.  Seed phrases are a bunch of words that are selected randomly and used to generate multiple private keys.  All these PKs are then used to give you your addresses.  \n\nWhen you generate a wallet on MyEtherWallet (MEW), you first have to enter a password.  This password is used to encrypt your PK and store that inside of a file called the Keystore.  This way, you need the keystore file and the password in order to decrypt and use the PK.  However, once you've gone through these steps, MEW allows you to simply view the unencrypted PK if you so wish.  In other words, password + keystore = private key, and private key -> public key (address).\n\nIf you want to use an existing address that you control in a wallet, you generally need to import it using whatever method the wallet uses to generate PKs.  In MetaMask, you have the option to use the private key alone *or* the \"JSON\" file.  (The UTC keystore file that contains your encrypted private key is in a format called JSON, so keystore/key file/UTC keystore/JSON file are all the same thing).\n\nYou could simply import your wallet into MetaMask if you want to use a single address, or you could just use two.  I have about 2 dozen addresses myself.\n\nTesting a wallet before you send a lot of money to it is a good idea, but you tested with about 2 orders of magnitude more money than you needed.  Sending .0001 is still higher than it needs to be really, but you definitely don't need to be doing more.\n\nIt also doesn't sound like you understand what gas is or how it works.  Instead of explaining it all here, just read my post **[here](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@tomshwom/ethereum-gas-how-it-works)**.\n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you want help starting over with everything and doing it step-by-step.

Coinbase owns and operates GDAX, but they serve two different demographics.  Coinbase is the simple/clean app for the very least technical.  GDAX is the trading platform.  Even if you're not trading, GDAX will let you deposit fiat (bank transfer that takes a week) for **free**.  If you take a little bit of time to learn how to use GDAX, you can also set limit orders for your buys and sells and be charged 0% in fees.  This is really good if you're putting large amounts in, and the general knowledge of market terminology will help you in the crypto space.  I'd be happy to help more with this if you run into any questions.\n\nFor your situation (majority in long-term, but easy enough to move if needed), a hardware wallet probably suits you best.  I'm a fan of the Ledger Nano S, but the TREZOR and others are arguably just as good.  Hardware wallets are not the epitome of security, as many people would have you think, but they do a very good job of making security convenient. \n\nIf the price of a hardware wallet is unjustifiable (whether it's because you don't have enough at stake or are confident that you can do better without one), there are many creative ways to security store your sensitive information.  I have a large 3 part security guide **[here](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-advanced-crypto-security-guide-part-1-privacy-security-and-trust)** that can help you.  Parts of it are out of date, but aren't necessarily incorrect.  I'm working on re-writing it in a wiki format so it's easier to navigate but who knows when that will be done.\n\nBetween software wallets and exchanges, I'm not sure which is better..  \n\nExchanges always have a risk of going down/being hacked/bad inside players.  You'd think the odds of this are low, but history has shown otherwise.  Personally, I only keep around 4-digits of funds in all exchanges combined at any one time, and losing that would be pretty devastating in my case.  If you use an exchange, make sure you're using the two-factor authentication options, preferably with an authentication app like Google Authenticator instead of text/SMS.  Text messages can easily be intercepted through SIM card spoofing on many phones.\n\nFor software wallets, there aren't really any good ones that support 2FA that I now of.  There's always the possibility that your passwords are being keylogged, or your clipboard contents are being sniffed, or your screen is being captured, so there's no good solution to avoiding all of these.  It's my opinion that high security cannot exist on a normal online desktop.\n\nWith 2FA, exchanges can be a lot harder to access for an attacker, but you have the risk of things going wrong with the exchange.  Software wallets are susceptible to all kinds of attack vectors, and securing them all is practically impossible.  Use software wallets as an intermediate between exchanges and interacting with things like ICOs or Dapps.\n\nI'll work on a step-by-step sort of thing some day, but I really think it's more important for people to understand why they are doing the things they are told to do rather than just following a guide.\n", 2], ["2017-09-05 22:05:34", "Hmm, I'm not sure I can accurately answer your question, but it's also not technically specific enough for the guys at /r/ethdev either.

For the example you're talking about, I think the focus would be to store a revision history of those important documents on the blockchain.  Maybe not the whole document, but just a hash of all the info in the document so that you can verify at a later time that all the info in X document's hash equals the hash value stored on the blockchain at Y time.

I would think it's more secure in the hands of somebody who knows what it is and how important it is, rather than in the hands of people who don't really know.  My recommendation: keep redundant backups so that you're not screwed if one is lost, and split the seed up into pieces so that you're not screwed if it's found by somebody who knows what it is.  Give half of the seed to your parents, and keep half in another safe place. I'd do this twice at least so that you have a backup for your backup.\n\nYou should update and reset your Ledger to start with a fresh seed, then send test transactions to make sure you understand how to send/receive/send back using the device.  Once you're confident that it's all good and you've made backups and tested those, then you can put real funds into it with confidence.  \n\nThe ledger uses a seed phrase which can be used to derive multiple private keys, but I'm not sure how the device utilizes this internally (if it's smart enough to look at multiple addresses instead of just the first).  There's really no reason to split across multiple addresses though, since they would all have the same level of security anyways.  If it's just to obfuscate how much funds you have from people you send transactions to, do it through an exchange as a proxy (they are effectively a coin mixer).\n\nYou should document what the device is and how to use it, keep these instructions in the same location you'd keep anything else your spouse would need in the case that you're unable to handle things.

I highly advise you to research and do your due diligence so that you're aware of the threats and risks associated with cryptocurrency.\n\nUntil you have a very good understanding of things, I'd advise that you keep your crypto on Coinbase.  Make sure your account is set up with a secure email, strong unique password, and two-factor authentication using Google Authenticator.  If you've never used Google Authenticator before, make sure you back up the recovery codes on an **offline** device or not digitally at all.

This means it's equivalent to a paper wallet (which can easily be generated and printed for free).  \n\nPaper wallets aren't the highest level of security by themselves though.  They can be lost, stolen, and damaged.  You have to carefully generate the private keys on an offline device (which hardware wallets do for you) and store them in a fire/water/theft proof location if you're looking for high security.  Even then, you should always have a backup which means you need to find secure storage options at least twice.\n\nA better method is to generate your private key offline, split it into pieces, and store all the pieces in separate secure locations.  Since no single location has the full private key, you don't have to be as cautious about the security.  This makes having redundant copies cheaper and easier, without sacrificing your overall security.\n\nIf you plan on trading, interacting with DApps, or just sending transactions out of your main account, a hardware wallet is probably the way to go.

Granted, this is a complicated subject where understanding cryptography, consensus algorithms, and other mathematically dense topics is needed to truly understand.\n\n>Wallets are a storage area for Ether\n\nFalse.  Wallets are a blockchain interface that make it easy to check the balance of an address, sign transactions, and perform other blockchain interactions.  Ether is \"stored\" on the blockchain and only on the blockchain.\n\nYour wallet section doesn't include the most popular solutions like Parity, Jaxx, or MetaMask.

For Ethereum, your fee for a basic transfer is 21000 units of \"gas\", where you pay X amount of Ether for each gas unit.  The amount you pay is the *gas price* and it can vary.  I'd highly recommend [this post I wrote](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@tomshwom/ethereum-gas-how-it-works) to better understand gas/transaction fees on Ethereum.\n\nThe transaction fee *does not* depend on the number of confirmations.  Confirmations are simply the number of blocks that are added to the blockchain after your transaction has occurred.  Waiting for block confirmations is just a way to ensure that the blockchain is valid and the transaction should be safe to honor.\n\n3) /u/-May is dead on with this one.\n\n4) Exchanges generally store funds in very large multi-signature wallets on an air-gapped system.  They use software to keep track of who has what balance, and \"your\" coins don't actually move around when you buy/sell, the database is just updated to reflect it.  Only when depositing and withdrawing does the exchange have to actually interact with the blockchain.  \n\nThe exchange does control the private keys, and this is why they are generally seen as less secure for the user.  The Ledger Nano S and other hardware wallets have the private key stored internally.  You still don't have access to it directly, but you do have the seed phrase which is used to derive the private key.

Ethereum has Ether (ETH), Bitcoin has.. well Bitcoin (BTC).  These coins are supported natively on the their blockchain.\n\nOn Ethereum, you can create smart contracts that run on the blockchain. Tokens are a specific type of smart contract that follow the set of standards called \"ERC20\".  These standards define the function of the contract and some basic rules so that all ERC20 tokens function similarly and can be supported in a similar way.\n\nSo ERC20 tokens on Ethereum are really just a smart contract that keeps track of what address has how much of the token.  To transfer tokens, you have to interact with the smart contract and tell it to do a transfer function from your address to another, and that execution is stored in the blockchain state.  This allows people to keep track of their token holdings just like they do for ETH.\n\nFor your second question, the answer is that it depends.  ICOs are smart contracts too, and can be programmed to do different things.  Many ICOs don't allow people to call the transfer() function until the ICO is over, which prevents people from trading them.  If the ICO allows users to transfer tokens whenever, then you can send ETH to the ICO contract and it will \"deposit\" the token to your address (it really just generates new tokens and marks you as the owner, then subtracts the amount from the ICO contract owned tokens).  \n\nLet me know if I didn't answer all your questions.", 4], ["2017-10-18 23:58:34", "Tokens exist conceptually as entries on the blockchain.

For example, Gnosis is a token on its own blockchain which is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and each token of Gnosis is worth the current market price on marketplaces and exchanges? Or is Gnosis just a token on the actual Ethereum blockchain and not its own?\n\nOne more question. Certain tokens have other attributes attached to them. For example, the Brickblock tokens will produce Access tokens.

When people interact with it (buy it during the ICO, transfer it, etc.) then they interact with the contract through an Ethereum transaction.  This transaction is mined into blocks on the Ethereum blockchain just like all other transactions are.\n\nTo be clear, Gnosis does **not** have its own blockchain.  You can see the Gnosis contract here: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96.  Take a look at the \"Contract Source\" tab to get an idea of how the token actually works.\n\nThe value of Gnosis is just like the value of Ether, it's totally speculative and is only worth what people pay for it on exchanges and the open market.\n\nI don't really know anything about Brickblock, and I couldn't find the contract source to look into it, but it wouldn't be that hard to implement something like what you're talking about in a smart contract.  \n\nFor example, the smart contract could have a function that says (in pseudo code):\n\nfunction giveAccessTokens(address _to){\n    balances[_to] = balances[_to] .add( (_currentBlockNumber - _contractLaunchBlockNumber) * multiplier);\n}\n\nWhen somebody executes this function, their balance would be updated and have some multiple of the block number since the contract launch of tokens added to their balance.\n\nIf it's currently block 1000, the contract was created at block 500, you get 2 access tokens for every block since the contract creation, and I call this function from my address 0xABCD, then address 0xABCD would have it's balance updated to be the current balance + [(1000-500) * 2].  Keeping two balances, one for the Brickblock token and one for the access token, is very easy.  You just have balances1 and balances2 or some other variable that is given a value.\n\nThe contract is stored on the blockchain, and when I interact with it the inputs and outputs are mined and also added to the blockchain, thus we have a ledger of my balance that can be check to see what it is currently and at any point in time previously.", 3]]}, "130": {"created": "2017-10-08 14:26:56", "title": "What to do with eth coins before the fork?", "num_comments": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "score": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-10-08 23:42:40", "I'm going to sticky this thread since it's come up quite a few times now.\n\nIn short: **you don't need to do anything unless you're running software that interacts with the blockchain, then you just need to get updates.**\n\nIf you're running a node, mining, or using some other Ethereum application, there are updates you will need to get prior to the fork.

The seed phrase is what is used to derive all your private keys, and if it is lost you have absolutely no way to get it back.  If somebody else gets it, they own your crypto just as much as you do.

It's not being \"given away\" so much as there will be two blockchains with the same history up until August 1. That means that any wallet with BTC in it before august 1 will also have that balance on the BCC forked blockchain.  BCC has a speculative value right now, so it *seems* like it would be free money, right?  I have several reasons to believe otherwise, but I don't think you really are asking about the value side of things.\n\nAs far as Ethereum goes, there's nothing that hard links it to the BTC price.  The entire cryptocurrency market likes to move up and down all together, so it seems like coins are linked sometimes.  Generally, ETH or BTC will make a big move up or down and the other one will follow soon after because traders believe they *will* be linked.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy really.\n\nIf BTC goes up drastically because they have fixed some of their issues, more money will come into crypto in general and all major coins will see some of that rise in price.  However, there are many who were only in ETH or LTC as a hedge against BTC if things went wrong, so those coins may suffer as people go back to BTC.  It's really a complicated and speculative issue, and you shouldn't take my tiny opinion with much weight.\n\nYou need to get an account with an exchange that does fiat (local currency like USD).  Coinbase is a decent one that I use, but there's others out there.  Getting an account can take some time since they do some verification, and you need to do further verification to raise your buy and sell limits.  From there you can place market orders to buy and sell BTC, LTC, and ETH (on coinbase).  If you want to be actively trading, you would use coinbase's trading platform GDAX.  They use the same account, so it's easy to use GDAX if you're already on coinbase.  GDAX lets you do limit and stop orders which is a must if you're trading.\n\nPeople generally recommend that store your crypto in a wallet where you control the private keys.  On an exchange like coinbase/GDAX, you do not have this control.  That puts you at risk if the exchange is hacked or some other issues occurs.  However, if you are not careful and informed about what you're doing, you are a much bigger threat to yourself than the exchange is.

If that doesn't make sense, it means that you are charged for filling an existing buy/sell order and are taking liquidity out of the order book.  People who make liquidity are the ones posting buy/sell offers, or makers.  Taker/maker is more relevant for people trading and doing limit orders, but if you're using coinbase then you're always a taker since all your orders are done at market price immediately.\n\nI would leave your funds on the exchange until you are confident about setting up your own wallet.  If you're holding for a long time and not actively day trading, then you should move off the exchange.  \n\nCoinbase is not supporting BCC.  They will likely sell the BCC chain tokens for profit to themselves like you say.  If you're trying to get the double tokens before august 1, you will need to transfer your BTC off the exchange to a wallet where you control the private keys.\n\nGemini seems fine, Kraken too.

There's one caveat though, \"fee free\" will never be something that works well.\n\nYou can throw common sense at this problem. It takes a lot of energy and resources to run a blockchain, and that costs money. That means somebody is footing the bill, and in decentralized systems it's all the miners. This applies primarily to PoW, but PoS doesn't entirely escape this either.\n\nIf you have to pay miners, you have a few options.  You can inflate the currency by constantly creating new coins to reward them, you can have transaction fees proportional to the amount of work the transaction needs to be processed, or both.  Right now, Ethereum does both.\n\nThere are extremely good reasons for this though.\n\nImagine if Ethereum didn't have transaction fees for a second.  That would mean that *anybody* could shut the entire network down by just spamming it with transactions.  My laptop could easily broadcast thousands and thousands of transactions per minute all by itself, and there would be little anybody could do about it.  \n\nIf the miners collude to block my IP, I go through a proxy. \n\nIf they block my address, I generate 10,000 more.\n\nThere's no good way to stop people from spamming a p2p network without transaction fees or artificial limits (which automatically hamstring the entire platform).\n\nOne solution to this problem is to make all miners basically supercomputers.  This is how NEO gets away with their fee structure and tx/sec numbers.  **However**, not just anybody can go out and buy a million dollar supercomputer.  That means there's a large hardware and wealth centralization issue, and that's not what you want to build your blockchain on.  Security issues from this kind of \"delegated\" miner system are inherent and unavoidable, but I'd recommend you DYOR on this topic since there's quite a lot of arguments on both sides.\n\nAnother issue with no fees is that there's either inflation of the currency (which is equivalent to everybody paying the fee since everybody's coin is being devalued), or there's no incentive for people to mine.  Both of these are undesirable and counter to what make decentralized systems work well.\n\n**What you actually want** are very small fees.  This comes with *good* scalability, and it's on the horizon for projects that actually are looking forward into the long-term instead of creating band-aid fixes like NEO has done.

I know nothing about how NEO differs in this respect, so I can't really offer any advice there.\n\nYou also mentioned that you're actually using a VM, not an offline *air-gapped* system.  The security benefits to this are pretty dubious.. \n\nIf you're using a shared clipboard between the VM and host, then you're susceptible to MitM clipboard replacement attacks (swap the address you're trying to send funds to for a different one, sometimes from a pre-made list of addresses that can be picked to look very similar to the one you originally meant to send to) and private key sniffing (just sniffs the clipboard and sends your private key off). \n\nIf you're not using the shared clipboard feature, then you're likely still vulnerable to screen grabbers and keyloggers.  This would effect you if you are pasting your PK into a field that doesn't obfuscate the value (MEW is bad about this).  Also vulnerable if you ever look at or print QR codes of the private key. You're unlikely to actually type your private key, but keyloggers can still be sniffing passwords like those used for your encrypted drive.\n\n> using Truecrypt to encrypt the drive, was long formatted before encrypt and yes total drive encrypt. \n\nSo TrueCrypt isn't hardware encryption, and I'd recommend switching to VeraCrypt if you go this route.  Really though, there shouldn't be a need for encryption at all on this drive.  The information you are bringing from the online system to the offline one isn't sensitive, it's just an unsigned transaction.  The information you're bringing from the offline system to the online one also is not sensitive, it's just the signed transaction. If somebody stole this, the worst thing they could do is broadcast it for you (which means you should never sign a transaction you aren't planning to immediately send).\n\nThe real concern is that you're transporting malware from the online system to the offline one, and encryption doesn't necessarily stop this from happening. In fact, infecting the encryption utility itself makes it even easier to side-load malicious software.\n\n> The computer I believe is safe, was just reformatted 4 days ago little software installed, only Major stuff like Chrome, Oracle VM, along with Antivirus (paid version)\n\nThis is all fine and dandy, but doesn't account for your network security. If somebody can access your wireless network (which they almost certainly can if you haven't updated your router firmware since the KRACK exploit), then there's nothing stopping a determined attacker from owning your system. \n\nAntivirus, even ones you pay for, are pretty horrible at doing anything other than retroactively detecting when you've already been infected.  They don't do a good job of preventing it from happening.  This is especially true for signature-based AV that wont detect anything unless the virus is known and the signatures are present on your system (AV is updated).  Since crypto is a pretty new space for lots of malware, much of these are not yet discovered.  Additionally, things like clipboard sniffing, keylogging, and screen grabbers don't inherently raise flags for heuristic-based AV.  There's plenty of genuine hotkey software (keyloggers), screen recorders, and clipboard-interacting software out there, so it doesn't look suspicious to most AV software.\n\n---\nLet's step back for a second here an really look at the risk you're potentially exposing yourself to.\n\nSinging transactions with your private key on a system that is currently or will be online is just a bad idea.  You're exposing yourself to the more likely exploits like malicious browser plugins, phishing emails that download malware, etc.  You're mostly avoiding this issue though by trying to sandbox execution within a VM, but this isn't really how VMs work.  VMs do a good job of keeping bad things contained, they do not do a good job of keeping bad things running on the host out of them.  \n\nI think the best solution to all of these problems is to **replace using a VM with using a bootable flash drive running something like Tails.**  It's less convenient because you have to do some rebooting, but if you use Tails correctly you actually get the true offline air-gapped benefits without needing a whole system of hardware. I have a popular guide on how to set this up on my Steemit blog [here](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-advanced-crypto-security-guide-part-3-creating-a-secure-wallet), and it's in the official MEW knowledge-base [here](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/offline/ethereum-cold-storage-with-myetherwallet.html).  Tails has Electrum already built in btw.\n\nI don't believe the drive encryption is doing a lot of good, but it's almost certainly not hurting you.  If it's not a hassle, keep it up.\n\nIt's very unlikely that you are being targeted specifically by somebody with the technical background & ability to really own your network and system in any meaningful way.  However, if you are holding a substantial amount of funds and are really bad at privacy, you can definitely make yourself a target.  For more on this, [part 1 of my security guide on privacy](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-advanced-crypto-security-guide-part-1-privacy-security-and-trust).\n\n**I'd still recommend seeing if your router has any firmware upgrades.**\n\nGood computer hygiene can be as effective, if not more effective, than traditional antivirus.  Things like not using extraneous browser plugins, managing cookies, regularly running malwarebytes, having *good* extensions installed, etc.  I have blog posts [here](https://steemit.com/security/@tomshwom/computer-hygiene-part-1-browser-extensions), [here](https://steemit.com/security/@tomshwom/computer-hygiene-part-2-cleanup-software), and [here](https://steemit.com/security/@tomshwom/computer-hygiene-part-3-antivirus) about things along these lines.\n\nAlright, now for the paper wallets...\n\n---\n\n> > Unencrypted PKs in QR code format?\n\n> Yes along with letter format\n\n> > Is it secured to protect from theft?

This is why I really dislike hardware wallets for not providing a good solution or recommendation for storing the seed phrase.\n\nHere's a simple and effective solution:\n\nDon't worry about encrypting your backup, then you just have to backup the encryption key and you never get anywhere.  Instead, split the private key info in half.  Store half in your fireproof safe, and half at your workplace/parents/friends.  Then, do it again.  This way you have redundant backups that would be near impossible for an attacker to access, and you didn't need to spend lots of money on physically secure solutions.  The information isn't very sensitive either, so you're not putting yourself at significant risk by storing it in an insecure location as long as you have a way to be notified if it ever went missing.\n\nYou can significantly improve on this strategy by splitting the PK into more pieces and storing them in more secure locations.  \n\nPersonally, I split my PK into 3 pieces.  If my private key was 'ABC', then the pieces would be AB, BC, and CA.  This way, I only need 2/3rds of the pieces to recover the whole key, so it's both secure and I'm okay if I lose 1/3rd of my backups.  Since they are stored at home, at my workplace, and in a safety deposit box, I have a reasonable expectation that I'd know if one was compromised before any of the others were also compromised, so I'd have time to react and move funds.\n\nI think I've probably written too much already, but hopefully it's been informative and can be useful to you.

This information can be found on the exchange's FAQ/help pages, or a simple google search should find them.\n\nDon't buy crypto if you already think you'll \"chicken out\".  It's an incredibly volatile ecosystem and +/- 10% movements happen all the time.  You stand to lose a substantial amount just hours after buying, but you also stand to gain a substantial amount in a short time too.  \n\nRegardless, the worst thing you can ever do is buy high and sell low, which is what many new traders end up doing.  I'd recommend building your confidence up by researching, making a trading plan, and trading with very small amounts (better if you can just do it on paper without any real money at all).  Never invest more than you can afford to completely lose.\n\nThere are lots of different workflows for buying and selling crypto.  Personally, I use GDAX, which is owned and operated by Coinbase.

Decentralized so you don't have to trust a single entity to control your wealth. And because there is a fixed total limit wealth can be stored and will probably on average not decrease in value. \n\nLitecoin is basically a copy of bitcoin with shorter block times, larger supply and different mining algorithm (~~no ASICs can be used~~ ASICs can be used but they are different than the bitcoin ASICs). It is useful in its own way and about 50% of trading is against the Chinese yuan see [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/#markets](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/#markets).\n\nRipple is created and controlled by the Ripple company. There are 100,000,000,000 ripple in existence but only 37.5 % is circulating at the moment. The distribution is handled by the company.\n\nEthereum is not designed as a currency. Yes, ether can be bought and sold but this is not the main purpose. The main purpose is to create a distributed computing machine that can execute programs by itself in public so everyone can verify what is going on and the machine enforces correct execution (no cheating). Executing a program has a cost (in ether) so there is an incentive to keep the platform running. Mining rewards and later on staking rewards are other mechanisms to reward people for keeping the machine running.\n\nSince this machine is Turing complete it can be programmed to do whatever you want. So this generates a lot of possible applications that can be built (for example the Distributed Apps or dapps). \n\nSo while I like the rising value of ether, it is not meant to be a store of value. And the price does not really matter for the machine to run. The number of ether is rising fast right now but will be more controlled in the future to prevent a huge inflation in the long run.\n\nRight now there is no telling what will happen/be done with Ethereum but people see a huge potential in what is can do in the future since it is designed to create other things on top of. This is why people are investing money in it and think it will have a bright future.\n\nBut we are still in infant stages and a lot can go wrong and the price of ether might swing drastically in either direction.

Credit cards operate on a \u201cpull\u201d basis, where the store initiates the payment and pulls the designated amount from your account. Cryptocurrency use a \u201cpush\u201d mechanism that allows the cryptocurrency holder to send exactly what he or she wants to the merchant or recipient with no further information\n\nImmediate Settlement: Purchasing real property typically involves a number of third parties (Lawyers, Notary), delays, and payment of fees. In many ways, the bitcoin/cryptocurency blockchain is like a \u201clarge property rights database,\u201d says Gallippi. Bitcoin contracts can be designed and enforced to eliminate or add third party approvals, reference external facts, or be completed at a future date or time for a fraction of the expense and time required to complete traditional asset transfers.\n\nAccess to Everyone: There are approximately 2.2 billion individuals with access to the Internet or mobile phones who don\u2019t currently have access to traditional exchange systems. These individuals are primed for the Crytocurrency market. Kenya\u2019s M-PESA system, a mobile phone-based money transfer and micros financing service recently announced a bitcoin device, with one in three Kenyans now owning a bitcoin wallet. (Let me repeat that again. 1/3)\n\nLower Fees: Many expect that most users will engage a third-party service, such as Coinbase, creating and maintaining their own bitcoin wallets.

If the gains are large, those penalties can be as high as 40% of the tax you'd also owe. In other words, if you failed to report $100,000 of gain, you'd be liable not only for the $100K but also potentially another $40K on top of that, plus interest. Usually a defense to these penalties requires that there be some authority that the taxpayer relies upon. As the article notes, here there is no authority yet so it is unlikely the taxpayer can use that as a safe harbor defense. Someone is going to be the pioneer on one of these cases. While they may ultimately win, it will be painful and likely expensive. At this point, with the 1031 theory untested, I would report the transaction and treat the gains they have earned on each cryptocurrency as taxable capital gain. My rationale is that whatever benefits one might get from deferring the gain for a while (assuming the 1031 theory ultimately succeeds) is not worth the risk of getting hit with tax penalties if the theory fails.

The Keystore contains the **encrypted** private key and some info on how it was encrypted.  You need the Keystore + Password to decrypt the actual private key.\n\n> and stored it on a flash drive. I also printed out the backup page with the QR code.\n\nKeeping it on a flash drive (offline system) is good in terms of storage.  This prevents malware from potentially sending it off to an attacker.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you generated the private key on an online system, and you printed the raw unencrypted private key.  That means you could already be compromised since your online computer, network, and printer are all valid attack vectors that have access to the sensitive information.\n\n> Then it prompted me to pick a method of accessing the wallet, and I got Metamask and had to put in another password and write down 12 words?\n\nWith what you currently have, you would select either private key or keystore/json file as the options to unlock your address on MEW.\n\nInstead, you selected the MetaMask option and created a new, totally separate wallet on MetaMask.  When you select the MetaMask option on MEW, you are accessing the MetaMask address.\n\nThe 12-word seed is essentially the same as your raw unencrypted private key.  It's in a different format because writing down 12 words is easy than writing down a big hexadecimal string of numbers.\n\n> Is Metamask like a completely new wallet? I thought it was just a way to access your MEW wallet.\n\nMetaMask can use addresses that are imported directly from private keys (like the one you generated on MEW), or it can generate it's own address via the 12-word phrase.\n\nMEW can use addresses it generates (private key or keystore+password), or it can connect to MetaMask to use the currently selected address on MetaMask.\n\nThey work this way because neither MEW nor MM are doing anything particularly special.  They are both interfaces to the blockchain that use private keys, and these things are standard to the Ethereum network, not the applications.\n\n> if I send ETH to the address I made on MEW (that is also shown in Mist Wallet)\n\nWhy is your address you generated with MEW on the Mist Wallet?  Did you import it to Mist?\n\n> I'll be able to access them? And I need to keep the piece of paper and the flash drive with the file from MEW, and then I can always access my funds from anywhere?\n\nThe one and only thing you need is your private key.  The address is derived from the private key, so you don't even need to store that (although it's good to know for when you just want to send funds to it since you don't need to expose your private key for this).\n\nIf your private key is derived from a seed phrase (like the 12-word one MetaMask uses), then this is the piece of info you need.\n\nThe keystore/JSON file is a secure way of storing the private key, but if you forget the password you will not be able to use this.\n\n---\n\nHere's what you should do IMO:\n\n\u2022 Start over.\n\n\u2022 Delete all the stuff that is for addresses with 0 balance to avoid confusion.\n\n\u2022 Download the MyEtherWallet client from their Github, and run it on your computer with the internet disconnected.  (Ideally you would use an air-gapped system, or a bootable flash drive, so that you know that malware can't compromise you during creation)\n\n\u2022 Don't print your private key, take pictures of it, or store it digitally whatsoever.  Instead, use a strong password that isn't susceptible to dictionary or brute-force attacks to encrypt your private key in the Keystore file.  If your password is strong, there should be no problem with storing the keystore file itself in the cloud and on multiple machines you own for redundancy.  **Do not** store your password on an online system, even if you use a password manager.  It should be brain-memory only.\n\n\u2022 Carefully write down your private key.  You want to keep backups of the unencrypted private key in the case that you forget the password to your keystore.  Check, double check, and triple-check for accuracy and legibility.  Test it using the offline MEW client to make sure it still points to the right address.\n\n\u2022 If you're storing any significant amount of money, consider getting a hardware wallet from an official source (not ebay).\n\n\u2022 If you think you're too smart/technical to spend money on a hardware wallet, you're wrong.\n\n\u2022 If you think that last statement is wrong, check out the [third part](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-advanced-crypto-security-guide-part-3-creating-a-secure-wallet) of my 3-part security guide (starts [here](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-advanced-crypto-security-guide-part-1-privacy-security-and-trust)) where I talk about creating your own secure offline/hardware wallet solution.\n\n---\n\nObviously this recommendation is more in favor of security over convenience.  Printing the QR code of the private key on a network-connected (online) printer is much easier and resistant to mistakes, but it is factually less secure than writing a private key down by hand from an offline system. \n\nGoing to the trouble of thinking up a properly secured password to store in memory is much harder than generating a long random one from a password manager, but it is simply (ever so slightly) more secure.  In either case though, a clipboard sniffer / keylogger will compromise you, so you should only sign transactions on an offline system if you care significantly about security.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR - No. Read it. All of it. Security is important.", 6], ["2018-01-18 05:44:15", "Wow, that was helpful! \n\nI read everywhere keeping it in a wallet was safer in case the exchange gets hacked.

Or do I have to do it manually?\n\nLooks like I'm in for doing a bit more reading and research anyway. \n\nEdit: I've read your series and went through the MEW knowledge base.

Assets without cash flows can still generally be valued by replacement cost or cost to produce (ex. Commmodities). \n\nMoney is different. There are no cash flows and the cost to produce is near zero. This reality makes valuing crypto (or money more generally) very complex. Crypto is even harder than traditional money because it has no country!\n\nWe examine three ways of valuing Crypto including as a currency, as a risky financial asset, and as a technology. We find that as a currency there is plenty of upward price potential. Cryptocurrencies have many strengths compared to fiat currency so wealth holders will likely continue to invest. As a risky financial asset the case is less bullish. Cryptocurrencies already make up a material percent of global financial assets. Investors will always have a preference for cash generating assets over cash, commodities, and other non-cash generating assets. Finally, as a technology we are not bullish on price. The basic tech is open source so there is a limit to how much firms are willing to pay (in the form of gas) for cost saving innovations based on external solutions like Ethereum.\n\nComments welcome!\n\nhttp://intuitecon.com/2017/05/28/crypto-market-valuation/", 7], ["2017-06-11 06:32:43", "I really like this post on Fat Protocols which discusses the value of the blockchain, http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols \n\nIn terms of private chains, think of the intranet vs. the internet.

For development, this is quite useful as you can have a rapid develop/deploy/test cycle. It's very easy to use and the advantages can't be overestimated. The way to use it would be the local development. Once you have your contract pretty much done, you go to the next stage i.e. one of the testnets (kovan or ropsten).

If you bought the Ether and it had already been deposited to your account and you withdrew it to an address you actually own, the Ether would be roll'd back into the exchanges address and you would've lost both your USD and Ether.\n\nIf you didn't withdraw the Ether, then the exchange still owns it and their internal database wouldn't reflect a withdrawal, so you would still have the \"credit\" to withdrawal your Ether from the exchange.\n\nThis is a bit hypothetical, but it's my best guess at how that scenario would unfold.  Each exchange may have different ways for handling something like this.\n\n> If i made transfers of tokens like mana, or whatever, and it cost me a set gas price, would the transfer of the token still have happened?\n\nNope. Token transfers on the Ethereum network are still transactions mined into blocks on the blockchain. When you roll the blockchain back, those transfers become undone too.  The gas you paid would also be rolled back, so you wouldn't be stuck losing Ether for transactions that no longer exist.\n\nHopefully this answers all of your questions about this.\n\n> Who makes the decision to rollback the blockchain?\n\nMiners.  They are the ones building and maintaining the blockchain, and all hardforks require miners to upgrade their software so they are mining the \"new\" blockchain correctly.  In the case of a rollback, you have to have enough miners to actually sustain the \"new\" blockchain.  If you don't, the chain will die.  If you have enough to survive, but the \"old\" chain does too, then you end up with a split like Ethereum Classic.\n\n>  I understand that it is supposed to be decentralised but if a group of people/organisations agree to make that decision, it takes away the aspect of decentralisation. \n\nMiners decide, so it's decentralized governance.  The fact that a lot of mining itself is centralized *is* something to consider.  This is a big reason why ASIC resistance has become a thing, seeing how centralized Bitcoin mining has become.\n\n> do i call it a rollback of the blockchain, or a hardfork?\n\nA rollback is a specific type of hardfork.\n\n---\n\nIf I didn't answer anything fully, just let me know :)\n\n\n", 8], ["2018-02-08 08:26:22", "So i have now thought of some more questions.\n\nIf all ERC-20 token transaction information is essentially wiped on creation of the new blockchain upon rollback, would that therefore mean all dapp information created post rollback would also be erased? Im using Mana as an example again, if i purchased land on decentraland during the auction process, along with countless other people, and a rollback occured to a time before the auction, that whole auction would be erased? \n\nAlso, if there were a split and the old chain didnt die, like ethereum classic, what happens to all erc-20 tokens on the old chain? Do they still exist? Would each token be split also? Do the developers of those tokens then choose which chain they wish to remain on?\n\nAll this is causing my head to hurt. Maybe too much thinking, but it seems to me that if a rollback happens then there are some pretty serious ramifications to the ecosystem.\n\nI like what you said about the asic-resistant chains to further decentralise. Is Vertcoin one of those? What other cryptos run dapps with asic resistant chains?

There are other solutions such as a bootable secure USB (like the one in my guide) that will protect you from all but the most determined hackers, i.e. state actors and 3-letter agencies, and if you have those one your tail then you're air-gapped system or hardware wallet really aren't going to cut it either.\n\nPaper wallets are *okay* ways to store crypto if they are generated securely and kept in a secure way (like splitting it into two pieces, storing each in a safe & secure location, and keeping redundant encrypted backups).  Obviously there are shortcomings when it comes to actually *using* the paper wallet, which is where hardware wallets come in.  They are at least as secure as a paper wallet but also very easy to use.\n\nThere are 2 types of \"possible\" to your bonus question. Philosophically, it is absolutely possible that somebody comes up with 256 1's and 0's in the same combination that you use.  Mathematically, this is not possible (in a sense).  If you're asking what it would take to guess a specific private key, on average, it would take 10^38 Tianhe-2 supercomputers running for the entirety of the existence of the universe to exhaust half of the 256-bit keyspace.. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/1x50xl/time_and_energy_required_to_bruteforce_a_aes256/).  There's also the question of how likely it would be to guess *any* key that has ever been used before.

Read in the paper wallet on your offline machine, generate a signed transaction, then transfer that to an online computer and send to the network. If you do this with a thumb drive you're still a little vulnerable; a true airgap would be to transfer optically with cameras and QR codes, but I don't know if there's a convenient way to do that.\n\nIt's theoretically possible that someone else could generate the same address as you, but exceedingly unlikely.

While somebody could simply pick up your paper wallet and go, they would have almost no way to possibly get your keys from a hardware wallet.\n\nSecondly, the only blockchain interaction that is a security risk is when you sign transactions with... you guessed it, your private key.  Doing this with a software wallet means typing/copy & pasting this sensitive information, same with a paper wallet.  \n\nHardware wallets take the transaction from your PC into its own hardware/software environment that is cryptographically secured so that no malware or keyloggers or anything can run on the device.  From there, it signs the transaction for you, and spits out the result. \n\nFrom your PC's perspective, it puts in an unsigned transaction (not a security risk), and gets out the signed transaction (also not a security risk).  \n\nThe reason why hardware wallets are not full-proof is because they don't account for the security of the backup seed.  They all use a long string of words as a \"seed phrase\" from which the private keys are derived.  You are usually instructed to write these down and store them securely, but if that seed is ever stolen then somebody can easily get your private keys and take all you have.\n\nThere's also, although extremely unlikely, the very small possibility that the device could be compromised.  This would almost certainly be through malicious firmware and would require physical access to the device.  The idea is that you would notice your device is missing and use your own seed phrase to get your keys and transfer your funds elsewhere if this happened.", 4], ["2017-09-06 21:35:58", "See [part 2 of my security guide](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-official-security-guide-part-2-wallet-analysis) for more info on the pros & cons of different wallets, and [part 3](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-advanced-crypto-security-guide-part-3-creating-a-secure-wallet) for a wallet solution that is much more secure than even a hardware wallet.", 3], ["2017-09-06 21:43:22", "The data that comes out of the hardware device is already the signed transaction ready for propagation to the public network so it doesn't really matter if anyone reads it. Sure, by hacking the partner software they can propagate to a node they control, but to what end? So they can include your transaction in a block and mine it faster for you?  They can't redirect the addressee and properly re-sign the transaction without your private key.  \n\nYour private keys are never exposed to the host computer, and key logging / screen grabbing normally isn't an attack vector, because it requires physical access to the device to enter a pin code with randomly located digits only visible on the device to login (which should also be starred / greyed out in the partner software).  \n\nPaper wallets are a great and simple solution, but at some point you need to type by hand or copy/paste in plaintext a private key or recovery mnemonic and interact with some software or website to transact.

It's a long ways off, but someday...\n\nMore importantly, you bring up some very good points that certainly aren't noobish.  \n\nFirstly, I assume every online system is already totally compromised.  When you download the MEW client and move it to the Tails drive, it is now isolated to that OS and shouldn't be able to report any sensitive information even if it was recording it. \n\nThere are ways to mess this up though, like running the Tails drive with networking enabled on a system connected to the internet.  Still, Tails routes everything through Tor, so it's unlikely that any malware would be configured to handle this.  Additionally, the only thing Tor can see (and the network) is what's stored on the Tor persistent volume.  KeePass shouldn't be located here, but in the other persistent volume.  However, MEW *should* be in the Tor volume so that it can be loaded in the browser, so I suppose it's possible that you a) enable networking at boot, b) have a specifically crafted infected version of MEW (even though it's open source and you can check the validity of the download through running a hash on the zip archive), and c) the malware is able to sniff sensitive data and route through Tor back home.\n\nAnother possible way would be to craft the malware to 1) sniff private info from the KeePass database or while it's in transit via the clipboard or key presses, 2) record, hide, and store this info on the secondary drive used to transfer the signed transaction to an online system, 3) retrieve this info on another system to be sent back home (or have the drive self-push the data).\n\nTo do this, you would need to compromise either Tails or MEW to contain the malware that sniffs the data and hides it on the drive. Again, you should be checking the hash of the downloads to verify authenticity.  You'd also need to infect the host computer so that it is able to retrieve the hidden data.\n\nThe other way is to infect the firmware of the flash drive.  This is something that would really only be done at the chip-level (modifying ROM isn't something you do with a piece of software).\n\nIn all of these situations, simply verifying the downloads, being careful with networking settings, and not using any flash drives some shady guy in the alley gave you *should* protect you.  It would take nothing less than the NSA to perform this attack with any confidence in the first place though, and if you have them on your back there's easier ways to compromise you (camera pointed at your screen, acoustic keylogging, torture, etc).\n\nAdmittedly, it's not the easiest or simplest way to do things.  A normal hardware wallet is more appropriate for most people, but this *can* be more secure since you don't have a single point of failure like a seed phrase, safer since you can make secure redundant backups, and cheaper.", 2], ["2017-09-07 01:35:39", "Missed some of your questions..\n\nIf you want to get notified of any video/reddit stuff or just new content, following me on Steemit is the best way atm.\n\nYou asked about the wallet generator in MEW.  The risk here is that it's not truly random, and the key it gives you could be guessed.  MEW uses the Node.js crypto module function `randomBytes()` last I checked, and this is a valid function to securely generate entropy.  As long as you verify the integrity of the download, you know you're using this function and it should be secure.\n\nYou don't need to trust Github, but you do need to trust the devs. However, since it's open-source, changes to the client are pretty heavily critiqued by a lot of people and you can rely on the community to some extent to raise any concerns.

You had me researching for a while to get the proper answer here. Thank you for asking such a good question.\n\n\n\nIn order to answer the question, you have to understand the purpose of difficulty and how it is derived. Blockchains like Bitcoin have target block times. Bitcoin's is 10 minutes. This target block time is designed to prevent blocks from being orphaned due to latency and keep a consistent timing. Difficulty is the variable that helps to keep this timing. Difficulty adjusts according to the total hashrate of the network. In Bitcoin, the difficulty is readjusted every 2016 blocks or approximately 2 weeks based on the previous 2016 blocks' block times. If the difficulty was too high those previous 2016 blocks, the block times would be high and would be lowered accordingly. Vice versa if the block times are too small. This can be observed currently in Bitcoin Cash; the difficulty of their network will be adjusted due to the severe decrease in available hashing power. The only reason the difficulty is increasing over time is because the increased adoption of mining has increased the network hashrate. If mining were to become less and less popular, the difficulty would decrease. \n\nSo why not decrease the reward? There are multiple economic reasons for this. Miners have to pay for their expenses and need to be able to rely on those rewards and fees to keep them going. In terms of Bitcoin, the structure of rewards was designed to imitate the rate of gold and to be deflationary. Satoshi wanted to use this slow decrease as a transition from relying on block rewards to relying on consistent fees. The idea was that as Bitcoin gained more and more users, there would be less need for rewards because the fees would pay the miners.\n\nEDIT: \"Wouldn't lower hash rate equal more miners (CPU and GPU miners) and make it less likely a 51% attack would be successful?\" Not necessarily. You have the same level of profitability in both scenarios. You can still mine with regular cpu's it is just not profitable. At a lower difficulty, your cpu would still be outpaced by a gpu.", 1], ["2017-08-04 04:17:29", "Thanks for the great response. Block chain technology is very interesting.

These should be helpful to anyone trying to determine whether the current price is reasonable. Here is a summary. Details included in the link.\n\nAssets with cash flows can be valued by discounting future cash flows (ex. Stocks and bonds). Assets without cash flows can still generally be valued by replacement cost or cost to produce (ex. Commmodities). \n\nMoney is different. There are no cash flows and the cost to produce is near zero. This reality makes valuing crypto (or money more generally) very complex. Crypto is even harder than traditional money because it has no country!\n\nWe examine three ways of valuing Crypto including as a currency, as a risky financial asset, and as a technology. We find that as a currency there is plenty of upward price potential. Cryptocurrencies have many strengths compared to fiat currency so wealth holders will likely continue to invest. As a risky financial asset the case is less bullish. Cryptocurrencies already make up a material percent of global financial assets. Investors will always have a preference for cash generating assets over cash, commodities, and other non-cash generating assets. Finally, as a technology we are not bullish on price. The basic tech is open source so there is a limit to how much firms are willing to pay (in the form of gas) for cost saving innovations based on external solutions like Ethereum.\n\nComments welcome!\n\nhttp://intuitecon.com/2017/05/28/crypto-market-valuation/", 1], ["2017-07-08 06:46:02", "Just kill two birds with one stone and play that popular gambling Dapp. :)", 1], ["2017-06-13 00:06:45", "Hold, hold, hold...

In the beginning of bitcoin alts were created and in large part took market share away from btc or were created for fast cash grabs. This was met with a healthy dose of critical thinking. But this developed over the years in a 'maximalist' approach handled by quite some bitcoiners. (Certainly not the whole community mind you!).\n\nIn my opinion this lead to people taking extreme positions and hostility. But right now a lot of fiat is directly flowing in eth and others, lifting the ecosystem as a whole and I think some some coins will coexist in the end. They do influence one another price wise but this will be less and less over time.\n\nA consequence of this is (imho) that you can choose a preferable chain to invest in (or spread it). Bitcoin is good for putting in value without having to trust a third party and trusting the value will not vanish or be taken from you. It has also been around for a long time and the network has proven to be very resilient. Development is slow due to the different visions and there is a lot of drama. But in the end it will survive and on average rise in value.\n\nEthereum is still very young. Because it can do so much, there are a lot more things that can go wrong. It also is being developed and is not finished. There is a lot of interest in what it might be able to become and it is building it's own reputation. Right now scaling is not really an issue with Ethereum but if the whole world will actively use it this will be different. Difference here is that problem is being worked on. Solutions are being developed to keep up with growth and a stalemate like in btc seems highly unlikely. \n\nThese solutions might work, or they might not, we have to see. I think we could see a future where bitcoin is use to store value and transfer it internationally (not for buying coffee) while Ethereum builds an network of trust that apps and such can use (which would be more expensive to use if you just want to transfer value).\n\nBut many an eth fan will say Ethereum can store value just as well as Bitcoin and I am only having this vision because I am nostalgic :) At any rate, it will take many years before it becomes clear what will happen and it won't go overnight.\n\nP.S.

It connects you, the user, to the blockchain.  MEW doesn't store anything, it cannot give you your private keys if you lose your backup (which isn't even a backup, it's your primary storage).  Despite the fact that \"wallet\" is in the name, it doesn't hold anything at all.\n\nWhen you create a new wallet on MEW, all you're doing is using the client to randomly generate a number (private key or PK).  Once this PK is randomly generated, the address that corresponds to it can be derived through a 1-way cryptographic function called a hash.  There is no good way to go from the address hash back to the private key, so an attacker only has one viable option for actually guessing your private key - guessing them all.\n\nSee [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY) to better understand how this is actually one of the highest security measures in existence, and why \"it's enough to enter a private key to access an account\" is actually incomprehensibly safe as long as the private key is randomly generated.\n\nIf you generate your wallet on MEW and use it as your primary method of sending transactions, YOU MUST STORE YOUR PRIVATE KEY.  \n\nMEW is a client-side interface that is run on your local computer when you visit the website.  If you're on the legitimate site, there is absolutely no way the client can compromise you. That means **your storage solution** and **your computer security** are what protect you, not MEW.\n\n---\n\nCoinbase and other exchanges do not let you know your private key.  There are many technical reasons for this, but the major thing to realize is that you don't actually own your funds if you (and only you) don't own your private key.  The exchange could be hacked, have bad players internally that steal, go bankrupt, have downtime when you really need to withdraw funds, block you for seemingly arbitrary reasons, and do all kinds of other bullshit that separates you from your money.\n\nOn top of this, you still need your own address that you control the private key to if you want to do pretty much anything in crypto besides buy and hold.\n\nIf you want to transfer to another exchange, you should go through a wallet you own first.  If you want to participate in an ICO, you *need* to do it from an address you have the PK to. If you want to play CryptoKitties, guess what, you need your own address that you control.\n\n---\n\nI've mostly talked about the negatives of MEW and exchanges, but here are my recommendations that highlight some positives.\n\n**If you're flat out stupid, tech illiterate, very new to crypto, worried that you're not careful enough to be responsible for your own money, or have any serious doubts about using decentralized technology**:  set up a Coinbase account with a secure email, strong passphrase, and Google Authenticator.  Make sure you have *handwritten paper backups* of your google authenticator seeds stored in a safe place.  If you are just holding funds, use the Coinbase \"Vault\" option for a solid extra security layer.\n\n**If you're familiar with crypto, public-key cryptography, general computer security, and are a careful & mindful user**: don't ever leave your funds under somebody else's control.  Use MEW, MetaMask, Ledger, and whatever else you need to, but be 100% sure what they do and how they do it.  If usability is a high priority, MetaMask and MEW are  your friend.  If security is more important, the Ledger and other hardware wallets are a good mix of security + usability.  If *extreme* security and privacy is what you need, then there are options for you, but you're going to need to be fairly technically competent. \n\n---\n\nRemember that crypto is unregulated, risky, and full of malicious software, phishing sites, scams, and dozens of other things trying to steal your funds.  There is absolutely no way to recover your funds if they are stolen, and no way to be refunded.  You are your own bank in crypto, and you shouldn't trust your money to a shitty bank.  Crypto isn't a get-rich-quick scheme and you stand to lose all of your money in an instant if you are not an informed user.\n\nPlease, ask questions, do research, be diligent, and explore what cryptocurrency is.

If you don't mind, I'm going to copy and paste a section from a FAQ I've been working on. Sorry if it's a bit bitcoin heavy, it applies just the same to ethereum though.\n\n###How should I store my cryptocurrency?\n\nTo simplify quite a broad topic, you essentially have two options: hot or cold.\n\n##Hot Wallet\n\nA hot wallet is any wallet that is connected to the internet. Typically this will be in the form of a desktop program or a mobile app. Hot wallets rank high in convenience, but are not suitable for large holdings. They are extremely vulnerable to malware and backdoors, and hackers have strong financial incentives to target desktop wallets. Never the less, they are perfectly reasonable to use for storing small amounts of cryptocurrency.\n\n[Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/releases/) - User friendly, good for beginners\n\n##Cold Wallet\n\nA cold wallet is a wallet that does not connect to the internet, and therefore cannot be affected by malware. There are multiple forms of cold storage, but the most important one to consider is a hardware wallet.\n \nA hardware wallet is a small, USB shaped device that you can keep your cryptocurrency. They are incredibly secure since all of the information is stored directly on the device, so you could plug it in to a computer riddled with malware, and the malware would have no way of interacting with your wallet. While not as convenient as a hot wallet, usages simply requires plugging the hardware wallet into your computer. \n\nThe main drawback of a hardware wallet is the cost (\u00a380 - \u00a3100), but they are virtually compulsory if you hold more than \u2248\u00a3500 of bitcoin/crypto.\n\nThe two options are: \n\n* [Ledger S Nano](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/b0c2)\n\n* [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)\n\nBoth are reputable and will serve you well. As of writing this, the Ledger is slightly cheaper and offers support for more cryptocurrencies. However, unless you need the greater cryptocurrency support, the choice between them doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\n###Why can't I just leave my bitcoin in the exchange?\nWhen you buy bitcoin from an exchange, the bitcoin is in your account **but** still belongs to the company who owns the exchange. Until you withdraw to your own wallet (as described above), the bitcoin is never truly yours. **The bitcoin does not belong to you unless you own the private key.** This is very important. Do not leave large amounts of crypto in an exchange.\n\nEven if trust that the company won\u2019t run off with your bitcoin (which is a pretty safe bet), an exchange is much more prone to getting hacked. Think about it from the perspective of a hacker: would you rather target a million individual users who only own a small amount of bitcoin each? Or would you target an one exchange that you know is holding unfathomably large amounts of bitcoin? \n\n[Still don\u2019t believe me?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)\n\n", 2], ["2017-12-15 04:02:43", "Yes", 2]]}, "456": {"created": "2017-12-14 15:35:14", "title": "For Canadian Noobies", "num_comments": 0, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "score": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": []}, "457": {"created": "2017-12-12 21:19:59", "title": "Mist Issue", "num_comments": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "score": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-12-13 06:03:31", "https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/108/how-do-i-backup-my-ether-accounts\n\nLet me know if this doesn't answer your question.", 1], ["2017-12-13 06:11:47", "Hey, I've backed up my keystore folder, however its Mist I'm having issues with, I've turned off my firewall, given geth all access, but it still cant find peers, that would be the first issue that needs solving, I've tried manually setting up a node but the FAQ answer on Github didn't seem to solve my issue", 1], ["2017-12-13 06:52:04", "If you need to use your funds, you can use MyEtherWallet with your keystore and password.

So they're super heavy on security, maybe too heavy, but hey no-one forces you to use them, if you do, then you know you're most likely on a much safer exchange than many many others. The team behind comes from the traditional banking world, so they bring in banking-level security, and having the Japanese FSA on their back means they had to do a whole bunch of security upgrades in 2017. Their interface is bit funny, some hate it, I just find a little \"too flexible\", you can move around a little too much and it can get confusing, it's a little \"UI over engineering\" if you ask me. They're planning to improve the UI though (announced this week in the Quoine bitcointalk thread). I'm actually writing a full \"Quoinex exchange review\" so I'll post the whole thing here. One thing for sure: it's not a scam. Just read the critics: most have no clue about trading and complain about slow withdrawals or price changes on Qryptos (because low liquidity). Hope that helps a bunch of you guys to decide whether or not you want to give it a try. Oh, and Quoinex has been in the game since 2014. If there is not much reviews findable, it's most likely because all their clients are based in Japan or elsewhere in Asia. For instance, the last 24h volume for BTC-JPY pair is about 150 million USD worth, whereas Quoinex's 2nd traded pair volume ranked is BTC-USD and has only 11.5 million USD volume https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/quoine/ . So yeah,  Again, double check what people say, \"most crypto traders have no fucking clue about crypto\". Adrien.

One of the built-in programs is simple transfer of Ethereum from person to person, so by default you get all the functionality of most blockchains baked in.  In addition to this, you can program things like token contracts so that even more cryptocurrencies can effectively exist on the same blockchain and benefit from all the core mechanics like low fees, fast block times, and high security.\n\nIt doesn't stop at this though, you can really program just about anything on Ethereum.  It might not be the right platform for many apps, but it's perfect for some.  \n\nThe role of miners is to execute the programs on the blockchain.  When it's a simple transfer from one address to another, that's still a computation that miners have to perform, add to a block, and then 'solve' the block by guessing random nonce values until a desirable hash is found. \n\nApps can be completely run on the blockchain, or just a small part of a program can utilize a decentralized function.  Either way, Ethereum programs are deployed to the blockchain in the form of smart contracts.  Smart contracts have an address, just like normal addresses, but when you send Ether to a smart contract address it performs a function.  Multiple functions can be available, and users select them with the extra transaction data they can send with the funds.\n\n---\n\nEthereum *can* be used to eliminate 3rd parties by replacing them with smart contracts.  The benefits to this are more than just fees.  When your 3rd party is a program, you can look at it and see exactly what it's going to do before you ever make a transaction.  Since the program is being executed by all the miners in the network, you can also be confident that the execution of this program will happen exactly as it's written - no errors.  This is why smart contracts are considered to be 'trustless', you don't need to trust that it will do the right thing or that it wont make mistakes.  There's also potential benefits from the transaction being stored on the blockchain, meaning it's immutable and can never be modified/reversed/omitted.  There's more, but this covers the basics.\n\n---\n\nThis is a tricky question.  There's more to cryptocurrency than just the technology.  Politics, community, and public interest/opinion are arguably just as important.

This is because computations in the EVM are done by *all* miners.  If more people are mining, more people are executing/checking the computation so they can mine/verify blocks.  That means the network is consuming more power, so it costs more to run.  This would likely manifest itself in an increase to the price of Ether (assuming the reward for mining approaches the actual cost).\n\nIf the price of Ether isn't high enough to pay miners, then miners will leave and the ones remaining will have a higher probability to get block rewards.

It can be used as such, but it's primary usecase is to pay for gas to execute computations on the EVM. \n\nMy take on this is: be glad you have some more time to accumulate at the current price. Selling will result in you kicking yourself in the head when it goes parabolic again. Nobody knows when that will be, but this being the disruptive tech it is, you can be quite sure it will. \n\nAnd if it doesn't, make sure your exposure isn't bigger than your comfortable with losing.

If you bought at $280, then you can lower that average cost by buying now at $260.  Put another $50 in and you will be in the black when it goes back up to $270.  \n\nKeep doing this whenever the price is lower than your average buy price, and wait until a big, quick price spike to do the same thing but selling.  \n\nSell some at a % that you're happy with, and then keep selling to raise your sell average.  When you run out of ETH to sell, or if the price goes lower than your average sell price, be looking for buying opportunities again.\n\nA good way to make sure you don't blow your load all at once and set your average at a bad spot is to limit yourself to maybe 10-15% of your total holdings in trades per day.  If you have $100 to put in, only buy $15 today to lower your average.  Then, tomorrow, another $15 (if it lowers your average further).\n\nOne thing to watch out for when doing this is flat-rate transaction fees.  They will murder your cost average if you're wasting money every day on small amounts. There are ways around this though.\n\nOne smart thing to do is regularly deposit what you can every paycheck into an exchange like GDAX for 0% fee, it takes 4-7 days to clear the ACH bank transfer and show up in the account.  When it does, do your buys/sells from the fiat in the account using limit orders since they are also 0% fee on GDAX.\n\nInstead of letting the fiat just sit in the account, you can also set limit orders that will be filled at large rapid price movements (over 15-20%). That way, you can catch the \"fluke\" spikes/dips to make large profits - the only drawback is that you need to be resetting these limit orders regularly so they don't just get filled off gradual market movements, you want to be able to hit the instantaneous price spikes and then sell/buy once it returns to the \"normal\" price.\n\n", 6], ["2017-09-23 01:22:55", "Solid advice.

I don't plan on day trading, but I am considering taking some of my ETH and trading for some other alt coins which I believe have some good potential in the long run.

", 2], ["2017-09-23 01:32:54", "For tracking altcoin performance, you can either compare it to USD or some other crypto.  For ERC20 tokens, I compare vs ETH since my funds would be in ETH if it wasn't in the token.  This helps to see which tokens are growing / shrinking relative to the Ethereum price, which cuts out the ETH volatility.\n\nComparing everything to USD is probably a bit simpler though since you can evaluate everything against a single reference.  You'll have to pay more attention to the numbers though instead of just red/black since the entire crypto market generally moves together.  That means your whole portfolio could go red at once (even if an alt is doing significantly better than ETH).\n\nIf you buy alts with fresh fiat, record your actual cost (after fees) and actual holdings (after transfer fees if you hold off exchange).\n\nIf you buy alts with existing crypto holdings, but want to compare it to fiat, record the fiat price of ETH or whatever you're trading at the time of trading for the altcoin.  So, say you bought 1 ETH of OMG now, you'd record it as ~$258 of OMG invested.\n\nIf you want to compare to ETH instead, just record it as 1 ETH and measure the change as $OMG/$ETH.\n\nEdit:  I wrote these blog posts a while ago that might interest you if you're using excel or google sheets for your portfolio and want live coin prices.  \n\nhttps://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@tomshwom/excel-portfolio-how-to-get-live-prices-and-stats\n\nhttps://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@tomshwom/importing-live-data-to-google-sheets\n\nEdit 2: I totally misinterpreted your entire question -_-\n\nDetermining the % of total holdings you want diversified into alts is complicated.  If you want to do it right, you need to do risk analysis on each asset.  If you think OMG is expected to outperform ETH, by how much? Over what time span? What is the risk that it doesn't meet this target (high risk/low risk)?  How much are you willing to lose before you close your position and cut losses?  What is your target sell price (or relative %)?\n\nThose types of questions will help you determine what's a good alt to trade into.\n\nFor security, you want to diversify into assets that **don't** perform the same.  So you want alts that aren't super tied to the price of ETH.  Look at historical price data to see which coins don't follow the ETH trend as closely.  Otherwise, you're not really diversifying - you're just holding a slightly different version of the same market.  Most ERC20 tokens are going to perform similar to ETH unless they are very new or get big updates.  Trading into a coin on a different blockchain like BTC, Dash, Monero, etc *can* help with this (though they still move very similarly).\n\nAn example of this would be Zcash.

They also execute all the code in all the transactions inside the block through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Whoever can create a block of transactions, execute all the code in the transactions, grab the hash from the previous block and add it to the hash of the current block, find the nonce value to make the total block hash a \"nice\" number, and finally broadcast it to the other nodes is the one who wins the block. It's a competitive race.\n\nIn PoS, it's not a race anymore.  You make the nonce trivial to find and instead \"select\" the miner to compute the block based on their stake.  This cuts down on the energy consumption and wastefulness of finding arbitrary nonce values.  Validators will then verify that the block is indeed correct, and the next miner will be found.\n\nStaking will remove availability from liquid ETH, potentially making the liquid assets more valuable.  This increases the blockchain security though since it's simpler to stake ETH than maintain a mining rig.  If rewards are good enough, ETH will have a huge number of stakers and it will be a secure decentralized network.\n\nPoW can potentially be gamed (as seen with Bitcoin and the ASIC manufacturers).

So essentially, currently their is a huge amount of inefficiency in the computation of the blockchain as miners compete with each other. But with PoS that inefficiency is removed as people work together to verify blocks, with rewards being allocated probabilistically by stake. Since staking is incentived by higher ETH prices (as your reward is worth more) and the more people that stake, the higher the price will go because of lower supply, doesn't this hypothetically lead to a large increase in the price of ETH (hopefully), until an equilibrium is reached between staker saturation and reward?", 2], ["2017-09-07 21:15:59", "1) Ethereum's PoW isn't the same as Bitcoin's\n2) Size is not the reason PoS is being used", 1], ["2017-09-08 01:14:49", "More or less, yes.

Can read more about that [here](https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/Casper-Version-1-Implementation-Guide).  But when it goes to full PoS, there's less reasons for people to be running those expensive mining rigs on Ethereum, so there could be a large migration of network security to a different blockchain.  This could drag the price down if there's a lot of FUD, and there's always FUD any time a big update occurs that people don't understand.\n\nSomething that really should increase the price though is zkSNARKs and Raiden.

If you generated your private key on an online system, then when you copied / typed it to the document for printing it could've been picked up.\n\nAlso, anytime you use your paper wallet to sign a transaction, if you're doing that on an online system you are negating all of the security provided by a good offline private key storage system like a paper wallet.\n\nSomething else that people don't think about a lot is that digital security is often easier than physical security.  When you print your wallet info, you need to keep redundant secure backups of it.  Say your house burns down, is broken into, or your kid/dog is just curious about what's in that upper drawer... You could store it in a safety deposit box at a bank, but that's also not a fullproof solution depending on your needs.\n\nIf you like the mental exercise of thinking about wallet security, I'd recommend starting with **[part 1](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@tomshwom/tomshwom-s-advanced-crypto-security-guide-part-1-privacy-security-and-trust)** of my security guide, and continue through part 2.  Part 3 is an actual guide for creating a wallet that I consider to be very secure and not too difficult.", 2], ["2017-08-10 22:50:52", "Yea looking for a mobile wallet where only I have the private keys.

It would be found out quickly and there would be somebody to trace it back to. You'd also have the support of a large community, which would help in any legal endeavors.\n\nStill, if you're worried about that, then the only way to defend yourself is to be downloading and reading the source code yourself and loading it manually onto your phone. Not only is this impractical, it's probably not possible for you to do a code security audit. There's nothing to keep a dev from posting the source code and uploading a different version to the app store.\n\nEven if your application isn't malicious, you are still running it on an insecure platform that has all the same problems as a desktop.  In particular, screen recorders and clipboard sniffers are very popular on mobile.  That means you can't copy/paste your PK, type it, or even display it without it being compromised.\n\nThese potential vulnerabilities are unlikely, but not impossible - similar to the possibility that Jaxx is storing your PK.  \n\nTo view your balance, just use a blockchain explorer and your public key.  Bookmark it or something, no reason to use a wallet for this.\n\nTo make transactions, there simply is no very secure way on an online device like a phone.  I'd argue that sending from an exchange is safer than using your own application for this, so the coinbase app is what I'd recommend.  It's actually *because* you don't have the PK on your device that makes this the better option.\n\nIf you really really really just can't accept anything but keeping your PK on your phone and using an open source app (that you're auditing yourself / trusting others & the developer who uploaded it to the app store, or manually installing from source on a computer), then I don't think there are any clear options.  Almost all mobile wallets are closed-source or tightly associated with a company (Status, Jaxx).
