Yes it extolls the values of mining for fun/education but I feel the other point is not stressed enough. With many mining rigs well into the thousands, I just feel it needs to be stressed more.\n\nEven I disagree with putting small miners and their sacrifice on a pedestal. Bitcoin mining is design purely to reflect the free market and the main principle it follows is supply and demand. At the moment the math just does not stack up. I know a $50 USB miner is cheap but I do not feel we should be placing people who buy them and put them on a pedestal at all because they are inconsequential. 10k of USB miner is only worth 333Gh/sec, It's a drop in the ocean. If they represent at least > 5% of the network I would say, yes you are significant but this is not the case. With Cointerra and Hashfast coming onto the market, the security of bitcoin's network will continue to rise dramatically. Hence we really should stop lying to ourselves that USB miners make a difference. We really should be pragmatic about things and stop trying to stroke our own ego.\n\nI just feel like the the poster missed the point about mining being worth it because most people are drawn to profit first, knowledge later.

I feel for anyone that has this as an argument should not even touch bitcoin mining with a 10 meter pole.

I was simply making a comment on \"on hand sales\", like Bitmain, whose order shipping process begins the day you place your order.

When people buy from me, I print off the stats page of the miner config, show them that there are no bad ASICs on the board, I guarantee them that the fans all work, the unit powers on, and hashes within an average range. Buying a sealed box is honestly a gamble. When I get a miner with an issue, I take care of that issue and don't sell that one until it's fixed.\n\nSo in the end, by buying from me, the customer has more options (they can buy any number they want, from 1-30), they can receive their miners almost immediately (whenever I get off work), and they don't really pay a markup over what Bitmain charges.\n\nI'm not sure about the \"X number of hours question\", are you under the impression that there's a limit on how long a miner can run for? We are running almost 100 S1s, and one of my customers is still running an Asicminer Cube (30 GH/s) that's almost a year old, without issue (although I think he's paying more in electricity than it mines now!).

I would appreciate if you could elaborate on what you mean by honesty, I consider myself to be honest, and have a well developed sense of ethics. I also understand that all retailers make a profit (off of me) whether it's my cup of coffee in the morning, the grocery store that sells me my produce, or the farmer that grows it. So I do see ethical (honest) and unethical mining hardware vendors in the market, but Bitmain doesn't make my unethical list. Their S4 is priced beyond ROI, but they are free to price their goods and services at whatever they like, and I am free to not buy their product.\n\nOther than that though, they don't hold my money with a preorder, they ship faster than I had thought possible from China to the USA, and their prices go down as the difficulty goes up.\n\nBut that's an aside, BFL was evil, I lost some money \"buying\" their cloud mining service (not much though), and they should not have taken their customers' money without delivering their purchase. Aside from mining that's illegal, and that's why the FTC is stepping in now.\n\nWhat do you see as honest business practices? A manufacturer has to spend a huge NRE to do a tape-out of an ASIC, and even if they order that ASIC in smaller batches than they could afford to do (which decreases their chances at recovering the initial NRE) and only build miners \"just-in-time\" for orders, their pipeline would end up taking longer to get hardware in customer's hands, and their operating costs would be higher, which would require that they sell their hardware for a higher price. Mining equipment already barely ROIs if at all, and forget about \"profit\". The S4 or SP30 is a good example of hardware sold at a \"reasonable\" non-premined price, but it will never, ever, ever break-even. So my preference would be to buy the S3. They sell it right at the ROI point, and they recoup the cost of ASIC design by also being a miner.

Just don't be fooled by thinking crypto is this knight in shining armor riding in to save us from governments and large greedy financial institutions. The underlying workings are the same or worse, and where it heads a decade from now nobody knows, depends on whose driving then.  At the end of the day, there's still a fight going on in the backroom to see who can profit and control the most out of this whole edifice that we call decentralized and the people's currency.\n\nIf u made it this far, apologies for what ended up to be a rant.

You can sell the ASICminer share to get your money back.\n\nWhat does that mean?  Assuming that the value of ASICminer shares doesn't crash, the time to profit is *zero*.

That means that demand will significantly overcompensate for profitability.  The last group of people to order will look at current projections and think that they can still turn a profit, but the current projections won't in any way represent the orders that have already been placed.

He estimates that we'll hit 500 Th/s in March 2014 and 1000 Th/s in August 2014. Show us your calculations.\n\nIt's a fact that a 5Gh/s miner will make around 0.018 BTC per day with the network hash rate at 1000 Th/s. It cost me $312 including shipping to the UK for my 5 Gh/s device. If we take the the exchange rate to be $120/BTC then it would take (312/120) / 0.018 = 145 days to make my money back. With the network hashrate at 500 Th/s it would take about 73 days.\n\nNow, lets assume the exchange rate remains the same, furuknap is correct in his network hash rate estimations and that BFL will ship orders placed today in 120 days (as opposed to the 90 days claimed by Josh). An order placed today would arrive on the 2nd of September 2013 and the hash rate would be around 240 Th/s. If everything remained at those values, it would take about 36 days to make your money back.\n\nAgain, show us your calculations.\n\nEdit: spelling", 1], ["2013-06-05 09:38:38", "BFL has been \"actually shipping\" for months, and are still catching up with orders made almost a year ago.

If you plug in the details for a 5 GH/s BFL miner, assume a 3 month shipping delay and a 24 month mining period, you would ultimately earn [$185](http://i.imgur.com/lVgbqie.png).  If you assume a 4 month shipping delay and a 24 month mining period, you would ultimately earn [$35](http://imgur.com/IVHVqbH)\n\nAgain, these numbers are purely speculative, but wouldn't it be hilarious to ultimately earn only $35 after a 28-month period?", 1], ["2013-06-05 09:02:11", "> Here's furuknap's estimates based on 20% increase in network hash rate per month per month. He estimates that we'll hit 500 Th/s in March 2014 and 1000 Th/s in August 2014.\n\nUh, no.  furuknap discusses the profitability of ASICminer and 100TH under multiple different growth models.  He did *not* make any concrete predictions on how the network would grow.  In fact, since he outlined multiple different growth models, it's very odd that you would pick only one of these growth models and decide for furuknap that that's the model he believes.\n\nHis growth models use arbitrary percentages that aren't based on anything.  The growth models are meant to be used for theoretical \"what-if\" discussions, not to be used as actual predictions of network growth.\n\nIf you're going to link to an estimate, why not link to an estimate that actually takes into consideration the currently known orders for ASIC miners?  That would only make *too* much sense, right?\n\n[Here](http://organofcorti.blogspot.com/2013/04/914-asic-earnings-23-april-2013.html) is such an estimate.  Note that this estimate doesn't reflect the current state of things as the estimate assumes that BFL has already started shipping.  Since you're banking on BFL shipping all existing orders within the next three months, I'm going ahead with this estimate and simply adding an extra month to the end date, which would mean a global hash rate of 500 Th/s by the beginning of September for a difficulty of over 64,000,000\n\nNote that this estimate doesn't take into consideration ASIC offerings that have recently become available.  Avalon has been selling ASIC chips directly and numerous batches have already been ordered with estimated delivery of beginning of September.  BFL has also announced plans to sell ASIC chips directly.  Block Erupter USB miners are now on the market and people have actually been buying them (despite widespread disbelief).  Numerous other ASIC companies have also announced themselves within the last few weeks, but it's unknown whether they will actually go anywhere.\n\n> Show us your calculations.\n\nI don't know what calculations would prove considering that everything is speculative.  The speculative nature of things is why I said \"I don't know if it's worth it\" in my very first comment.\n\nIf you optimistically assume that BFL can deliver new orders three months from now, that would be the beginning of September.  With the above estimated difficulty of 64,000,000, that would mean a break even time of at least two months.  After the two months, you start earning profit at whatever the difficulty will be at that point in time.  Let's say that difficulty is 80,000,000 after those two months, which would mean an initial profit of $3.8 per day, with the amount of daily profit decreasing over time.\n\nHow fast would daily profits decrease?  That's impossible to predict, but if the trend from the last four months continues, the annual profitability decline will be greater than 90%.  With an annual profitability decline of 90%, according to the BitcoinX calculator, after you manage to break even, 12 months of additional mining would yield a profit of at most $542 (and that's assuming free electricity).\n\nConsider the possibility of earning only $542 after seventeen months, then weigh it against the risks you are taking.  What if BFL takes significantly longer than three months to deliver new orders?  Considering their history, that's not entirely unlikely.  What if the unproven devices are failure prone upon mass production/distribution?  Again, considering their history, that's not entirely unlikely.  What if the unproven device fails after six months of mining and BFL isn't willing to replace it?  That would suck, wouldn't it?\n\nTo conclude, I go back to my original statement: \"I don't know if it's worth it\".

That could really end up going either way. Many people are already very upset with BFL, but this might bring attention to their company they might benefit from.\n\nIt's really hard to say at this point though, and I'm quite unclear on the grounds for the lawsuit. I understand he's trying to declare fraud, but again, BFL says nothing on its site about using their equipment to make money, that's just the popular use of their machines. Specifically it says, \"manufactures a line of high speed encryption processors for use in bitcoin mining, research, telecommunication and security applications.\"\n\nThey're not selling an investment opportunity, they're selling experimental equipment for an experimental software. And experimental software are the words from the bitcoin.org site. Additionally, since the US has no clear legal definition for bitcoin (virtual currency or commodity), it will be very difficult to make this case.\n\nI intend on following this story closely, but at this point it could really go either way.\n\n*edit: I welcome any discussion on this subject. I am unwilling to take sides based on my experience with BFL. I cannot definitely side with BFL because they've certainly screwed up as a company, but I can't completely side with this guy who made a possibly stupid investment with unrealistic goals.", 18], ["2014-01-18 00:54:21", "The trial gets delayed", 7], ["2014-01-17 23:24:54", "[deleted]", 4], ["2014-01-17 23:32:34", "How do you join the lawsuit? lol", 3], ["2014-01-18 02:45:16", "The greatest gain of this is that it will get the word out even more that BFL is a scam.", 2], ["2014-01-18 05:47:19", "This just goes to the point that unless you already have access to the hardware it's no longer profitable to mine.", 1], ["2014-01-18 11:19:09", "Those figures seem a little off...", 1], ["2014-01-18 06:16:55", "Consumer protection statutes often impose implied terms into contracts for the sale of goods such that the vendor warrants that the goods are fit to be used for their intended purpose. Whether the purpose of BFL products is narrowly defined (by the court) to be \"mining bitcoin\" or broadly to be \"mining bitcoin at a rate that produces a profit\", or even something in between like \"mining bitcoin at a rate that costs less than electricity\"is the critical issue. Given that mining equipment tends to have little other use, I could see the court being sympathetic to the plaintiff's argument if he frames it as such.\n\nAs to the previous commenter's point about not having an eyewitness to the alleged fraud, the beauty of the litigation process is that you get to depose defendants under oath and ask them whether they did the things you claim they did. They could lie, of course, but unless they're very good about lying about a lot of different things, you can ideally succeed by using the defendant as your best \"witness\" to a fraud you couldn't otherwise prove on your own. Besides, if BFL has to disclose their financial records, it shouldn't be that hard to tell if they've been doing what this guy alleges - there would have to be a money trail, especially with bitcoin.", 1], ["2014-01-18 07:27:34", "Is there a class action, or only this one guy?", 1], ["2014-01-18 13:33:41", "I think it may be difficult to peg a value to the mining income that he lost from Butterfly Labs' inability to deliver. BFL of course isn't entirely responsible for increases in difficulty; if they had shipped their products on time, the difficulty would have likely increased much faster as more ASIC miners went online. So even if one calculates the BTC he would've accumulated had he run x GH/s over a certain time period, that likely would not have been reality had BFL delivered.\n\nOf course, if they uncover that BFL has been running a massive mining operation for themselves using hardware that should have been sent to customers, that's fraud. They'll probably say \"we were just testing the hardware\" or the like. Consider that the difficulty after they got the first ASIC miners online was much lower than it was in coming months, and they had an unprecedented opportunity to make money on mining. If they ran massive mining farms with their ASICs for extended periods of time and generated tons of BTC while they claimed shortages, that seems like fraud against not just BFL buyers but Bitcoin miners as a whole.\n\nOf course they can say it was for \"quality control\". Testing the chips to ensure they hash properly seems reasonable. To avoid conflict of interest, though, the majority of actual testing should have been done *off the Bitcoin network*, possibly with a short period of \"online\" mining at the end. But if there was little/no realistic reason to suspect defects while they mined or said \"testing\" went way beyond industry standards, then they could have just imposed artificial shortages to make themselves rich. In the race to develop ASIC miners, BFL probably had an asset that nobody else had. If they generated massive amounts of BTC, or even worse these went directly to personal wallets, that sounds like serious grounds for fraud/embezzlement. But there is little precedent for Bitcoin in these sorts of cases, so we'll have to see what happens.\n\nYou also have the issue of the massive increase in BTC value. BTC was only worth around $100-150 when he purchased it (at most, $250 at the peak last spring). In the previous 6 months, it underwent a massive increase to $1200/BTC and for now seems to have stabilized around $800. Is he trying to claim that all of his mining gains would have been kept or sold at current/peak prices, or are these losses reasonably calculated based on what he *really* would have sold them for along the way?\n\n**tl;dr** too many variables, too little court precedent. It's tough to reliably say how much $ he really lost out on had BFL delivered.

I don't think that's a good angle of attack from a legal perspective mainly because unless he has an eye witness it is impossible to prove. \n\nIf I was suing, I would focus on the inability of BFL to manufacture and deliver the product in a timely manner and how they're ineptitude caused loss of revenue for the customer.\n\nAlso, I don't think it matters that bitcoin is experimental.

Here is the story/email I sent to manufacturer:\n\nBefore I consider returning the R-box I bought. I wanted to see if I could get some help troubleshooting with you.\n\nI got my R-Box about a week ago. Opened it and hoped to get to mining. I realized I didn't have the power cable so I bought one on Amazon----- Model: DC12V5A  Input: AC100-240V    ~50/60Hz  1.5A   Output: DC12V  5.0A.  \n\nI added that information about the power cable in case that was related. \n\nI used setup videos on youtube to get it working. I downloaded Zadig to get the USB driver and I downloaded CGminer to mine on. Once I had the programs needed and set them up to Hash with BTCGuild pool, I plugged it in and started hashing. It worked exactly as expected and I started messing with the power settings of my laptop (which it runs on) to reduce the power spent while mining. One thing I noticed while doing that is that the R-box will stop mining if I adjusted the brightness with the laptop function keys. I also planned on just leaving the screen off while it works because then it would waste even less power. The R-box also stopped mining when I used hotkeys to turn the screen off (the blue light stopped blinking right when the screen turned off). I wondered if it would do the same thing if I let the computer idle and the computer turned the screen off by itself. IT WORKED. I set my computer to black out the screen after 1 minute of idle and the miner kept going.\n\nI decided I would check on it an hour later to make sure I didn't drop to low on my avg GH/s. The hash rate was great until I moved my mouse to turn the screen back on (34 GH/s avg over ~1 hour). It quickly started dropping. over the next 15 seconds it dropped to 0 and then wouldn't recognize that there was anything even connected. I restarted my computer. When the computer restarted it said something was wrong with a drive and it went through a bunch of files. It took a long time and I didn't sit around to watch it. When I came back the computer was back at the desktop with no messages so I assumed it wasn't that. I restarted CGminer. I tried looking through forums for a while for a solution. I don't have any solutions. If I can't get it working I will try to return it.\n\nSorry this was so long. I assume the more information, the better you could determine where I went wrong, if at all.\n\nEdit: The computer recognizes that the miner is plugged in but only CGminer says there's no device.

But they should be identical aside from the GUI, right?\n\nEdit: **Got it!** So the first thing that was going wrong was that cgminer has changed how it gets its input address.

They don't exactly fit in the socket. The two bumps on the power connector are closer in so some cringe-worthy forcing will be required to actually connect the fans. They run quieter than the PSU does (than fans are rated at 35 decibels). When I measured the decibel rating of the stock fans it was around 75 decibels (I was using an Android app though so I don't know how accurate it is).\n\nDo not install these in a hot environment. I am lucky enough to have a small dorm room with an A/C about 5 feet away to help keep it cool, but these do not have the same airflow as the stock fans. They are limited to ~2250 RPM where as the stock fans go upwards of 3000. If you use these the temperature of the machine will go up but the highest mine has gone is 65\u00b0C (which is higher than optimal but still fine).\n\nEDIT: Okay so I should update this for anyone about to buy these fans to mod their S4. These are NOT fans for people that don't have cooling nearby. My A/C in and out are within a yard of my S4 because I am in a small college dorm room. If you run these in a regular room your temperatures will hit 80 degrees Celsius in no time at all. You CAN however prevent this. The lowest I have gotten in a normal room with these fans is 75/76 degrees Celsius. That isn't very optimal, mind you, but it is low enough to keep the miner on for a while and the temperature will likely drop as winter comes (unless you are in the southern hemisphere in which case you can do this now in the cooler weather). The way I got this was setting the miner at stock clock speed (200M) and undervolting the S4 to 0715. That's the lowest I could go without it being finicky, but if you can get lower that will also reduce the temperature. The hashrate wasn't affected by this drop in voltage (as far as I can tell). It isn't a very large drop, but it does take your miner from hitting 80 in less than a minute to fighting to reach 76. This S4 with these fans is about as loud as one of those old Windows XP computers (the humming sound if you remember that) and it is mostly due to the PSU. I personally don't mind the humming though as it is medium pitched and not very loud (versus the stock fans banshee screaming). \n\nIf anyone else has another mod (fans, water cooling, etc.) to get the noise level down but the cooling up please speak up!

As long as your mining efficiency is better than break even for the power you'll make $1700+ in bitcoins.  Assuming you were going to  have to burn that electricity anyway for heat, your net cost is $1500 instead of $1700 for the season.  \n\nNext season you only swap the mining boards so your cost is $1000 for 1000W, but you can reuse the $500 radiator unit.  Assume you again break even, now your net cost for the season is $1000.  Or, if instead you keep your old boards which are now mining at a 50% loss, then you spend $1700 in electricity for 1000W of heat and make $850 of bitcoins.  Either way, you cut your power bill down from $1700 to $850 (or $1000 if you upgrade).\n\nIf the bitcoin price goes up, your mining efficiency is greater than break even on power or you can use the heat all year (eg. to augment a water heater) then the economics look even better.  If the bitcoin price crashes or mining difficulty increases faster than expected, you'll lose; nothing ventured nothing gained.  \n\nThis is not a get rich quick scheme, this is a get rich slow scheme.    And hopefully fun; people spend much more money to overclock their home PCs with no financial gain.\n\nThe three caveats you need to accept are:\n\n1) you were going to spend the electricity for heating anyway (24x7 during the coldest months)\n2) your mining revenue is greater than, or equal to your electricity costs to run the mining boards (during the 1st season)\n3) the up-front cost of the mining boards is less than the cost of a season of electric heating\n\nNotice that the only real unknown is the mining revenue.  However, it is safe to say that the expected return for any mining boards should be very close to the cost of the electricity or else no one would even consider buying it.  From a strict business perspective, the mining operation still runs at a loss of the invested mining equipment ($1000) even if you break even on electricity.\n\nA clever accountant might also recommend you treat the whole thing as a small business.   Then you can deduct the cost of the mining equipment and electricity against the bitcoin revenue and take any loss on your taxes for a few years.\n\nPlease let me know where my math is wrong; I know I am taking a big risk by proposing a profitable scenario for mining in this subreddit. :-)", 2], ["2014-09-18 23:58:48", "Nevermind.

BFL products for example will likely arrive when the difficulty is too high, resulting in never break even.\n\n**How important is that 9k to him?** If he looses it all, will he have large financial issues, or is it a drop in the bucket? Mining is EXTREMELY risky right now because timing is absolute key, the longer you wait the less money you will make, if any at all, and therefore the less likely you will make a full ROI.\n\nSeeing as how he knows little about bitcoin, little about mining, and little about computers, assuming that 9k is a somewhat large purchase for him, I would advise he seek a refund as soon as possible. He is ill equipped to make a well informed decision on if the risk is acceptable to him, and like I said here, the risk is massive.\n\nHere is a fantastic web app to tell you if you will or will not break even based on difficulty rises (I would stick with at least 60% per week), electricity costs, Ghash/s, initial investment, when received, and other good variables. Take a look at that and show him, if he at least did not take a look at any mining chart then he is likely to be an utter fool who will be parted with his money.\n\nhttp://mining.thegenesisblock.com/ <-- mining chart", 8], ["2013-08-21 23:38:16", "I can answer better if I knew which miner was ordered.", 7], ["2013-08-22 00:54:35", "[deleted]", 7], ["2013-08-21 23:57:27", "he should have said goodbye to his money.

If, for instance, the network hashrate reaches 20 PH/s (just picked a big number here), and ASIC prices have dropped to $2/GH/s, spending $1MM gets you less than 2.5% greater network share. If you had 35% of the network, to get to 51% would cost you more than $12MM, and that's only if no one else adds hashrate. You'll also have bumped difficulty another 20% or so. You may very well be right, but my intuition says that diminishing returns would discourage any attempt like that. A more likely scenario, IMHO, would be one large operation buying out another.

It does not matter how many intermediate credits I need to exchange my 1 hour for 4 burgers.  Over time that exchange rate can change, but as long as I can still work an hour and get about 4 burgers then nothing has effectively changed. \n\nMoney is only useful as an intermediate storage of value for the purpose of n-party (any number of parties) bartering.  We have forgotten that and started to believe that the money is the \"real\" thing and that the other stuff, our time and the goods we are exchanging our time for, are the ancillary concepts.  When the perceived value of \"money\" changes based on artificially controlled and uncontrollable circumstances we perceive that our real goods changed in value or cost.  But it is not the case.  \n\nA candy bar is still worth one candy bar.  One hour of labor is still worth one hour of labor.  But when our performance is based on our rate of acquiring intermediate instruments of exchange as if they equate to real goods then our priorities have been shifted from something real to an imaginary world where numbers in a grid are treated as being \"real\" and the goods moving along with them are seen as being secondary.  \n\nYou are trading hours of your life for goods and services.  The intermediate instrument of exchange has nothing to do with it other than convenience.  Over time that exchange rate can swing any direction you want, and the only people that will really affect are those trying to gain an advantage, to extract more imaginary ledger entries out of the chaos, to steal from other users by taking advantage of the volatility. \n\nWhen you value your life based on a number in a ledger that someone else can control then you have no control over your life.  If you count your wealth in the actual goods you have available to you, and your ability to produce such goods, then you are valuing your wealth in real things.  When you look at your output as simply hours of your life dedicated to whatever task, then you realize that your value as a human being is not tied to your ability to accumulate imaginary numbers in *somebody else's* ledger.  Why should you be paid more as the CEO than the customer service rep answering the phone and *actually interfacing with the customers*?  Hours are hours, burgers are burgers, and anything in between is actually, literally valueless.   \n\nThe cost of bitcoin will change based on many factors, but they will still be bitcoins and they will still be useful as an intermediate instrument of exchange.  That is what they were designed for.  Sure, people speculate.  Sure, people try to trick others into losing money so they can gain it.  Sure, over time the change in value can cause temporary increase or decrease in the purchasing power of a holder of the currency, but if you are holding instruments of exchange instead of things of real value then you are subject to the whims of the market surrounding that instrument.  \n\nIf you want to hedge against loss buy honey, or stockpile aluminum, or any other real commodity that retains its value and function.  If you want increase then buy seeds and plant a garden and let everything go to seed, resell seeds.  Buy clay and make bowls and cups out of it and resell those.  Put time into something real and get more real goods out if it, if you want to see an increase in your assets.  When you go to exchange those real assets for other assets you may need to use an intermediate instrument of exchange, but only use it for as long as necessary and turn those imaginary numbers back into real goods as quickly as possible.  \n\nThe takeaway is that these people will have a machine that produces these intermediate instruments of exchange and those will have functionality no matter what they are valued at, because people will simply adjust the amount of real goods they exchange for these instruments.  We know they will continue to increase in value, or instead they will become more plentiful, but the effect is that the same number of hours will be traded for the same number of real goods no matter how many are produced or how much electricity is used to produce them.  They are the imaginary variable we are using, an idea that allows n-party exchanges to be efficient.  But they are nothing more than an idea, and have no more value than what you can trade them for.  \n\nIn addition you can still participate in unexpected windfall gains while risking almost nothing.  I bought bitcoins when they were worth $7, sold on the way up to $30 twice and still has as much value in USD remaining after taking 200% out.  On the way down I lost as much as I put in, but it was all unexpected surplus.  At no time did I have more than I could afford to lose in the market.  I could have lost everything and not been significantly harmed, and instead I took advantage of immense increases and lost nothing.  Because I kept all my value in real goods, except for a functional amount that I had risked in order to conduct business.  \n\nI've given more background and a few examples of the principles in action.

Bitcoin is self-adjusting on the user side. There is scarcity, although not as much as was planned because fast mining is putting the release of new coins well ahead of schedule.  \n\nThis is an interesting one, but again the only reason that we are mining faster than scheduled is because there was so much interest that new technology was invented to solve the problem.  Our goal is having the last bitcoin mined nearly 140 years from today.  If that ends up being only 70 years it was only because the growth *remained* exponential for the duration.  What you are seeing here is a correction happening in the opposite direction of what we are used to seeing.  But it is still a correction.  Once we shoot past that inconsistency it will normalize again real fast.  \n\nBitcoin may have only been around for a few years at this point, but the protocol was designed for nearly a century and a half of ramp-up.  The volatility we see is noise in the long run.  The $7-30 USD/BTC example I gave is so far back now as to be dwarfed by the $260+ spike this year.  We went from a few million dollars market capacity to over a billion USD worth of value floating around in bitcoinland today.  \n\nThe events of this year are but a blip on the history of bitcoin.  ASIC miners do move the numbers a bit, but the increase is not expected to last forever.  Making predictions while looking only at the bitcoin and not all the other imaginary and real goods it is being exchanged for provides a very limited picture. \n\n> 3\\. Mining issues only have a very remote effect on coin exchange rates.  \n\nOn what timescale?  Today? sure.  This year, demonstrably false.\n\n> 4\\. The problem with the value of the currency isn't mining, it's that \"investing\" in Bitcoins isn't remotely investing or even speculation.  \n\nI don't know what you mean specifically by this statement.  If you hedge your USD in BTC in the hopes of it remaining or increasing in value that's \"investing\" and \"speculating\".  Maybe you don't use the same definitions of those terms as I do, or you are trying to make an argument that I don't quite glean from your words.\n\n> 5\\. With Bitcoins people don't have any value to relate it to except a vague measure of popular acceptance.  \n\nThat's pretty much my entire point.  Bitcoin is artificially bound imaginary currency that is not debt.  That makes it a new paradigm than we are used to, and we try to force a number of systems on top of it that it cannot, by design, support.  Our understanding of bitcoin is limited, and we interpret it through all sorts of inappropriate models because we don't understand it.  \n\nIn order to understand what bitcoin is, we have to clearly define what it isn't.  It isn't real.  So when you trade you real hours in the day for real food using an intermediate currency you have to remember that \"With Bitcoins people don't have any value to relate it to except a vague measure of popular acceptance.\"  Therefore it's transient value is irrelevant, just use it at the value it is at today to effect the trades you need to effect and enjoy your real goods that resulted.\n\n>6\\. Bitcoins right now are somewhere between Beany Babies and a roulette wheel.  \n\nAs I said above, you can't apply models that are inappropriate for the idea.  Until you understand what bitcoin is and isn't you cannot just throw analogies at it to see what fits.  \n\nBeanie babies, turnips, and other inflated real goods seem to be analogous, but they are not imaginary, only the value ascribed to them is.  With bitcoins there is nothing but a ledger entry indicating your stored value.\n\nA roulette wheel is a tool that randomly distributes funds of any kind that were placed into the system to one or more outputs, that's nothing like bitcoin which is producing new ledger entries in a public ledger with specific rules for moving those ledger entries from one address to another.  \n\n", 1], ["2013-08-17 04:24:06", "You know what?

Here's what happened:\n\n1) In photo #2, one of the ceramic capacitors (the brown things in pairs next to C240 and C241) failed with an internal short. Those capacitors are right across the main power bus feeding the GPU's voltage regulators.\n\n2) Its not practical to use fuses as a short-circuit protection in modern computing hardware. With most parts operating in the 0.9 to 3.3 volt range, the fuse would dissipate more power than the circuitry it protected. So instead, computer power supplies have 'short-circuit detection' built in. If the circuitry attached to them draws too much power, they shut down. However, most hardware also draws a massive surge of power when its first switched on as the capacitors charge-up. To account for this, the short-circuit protection doesn't kick in until about 1/10 of a second after the power supply is switched on.\n\n3) Your computer's power supply operated \"as designed\" and cut power to the system when it detected a fault. It also engaged a fail-safe mechanism which locked-out the supply until it was physically unplugged to warn (experienced users that know about this) it was in \"safety shutdown\".\n\n4) When you unplugged the supply and switched it off again, it reset the fail-safe and let the supply briefly send hundreds of amps to the video card, dumping it across the shorted capacitors. This caused them to explode, then form an arc across their contact pads.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_flash\n\n5) Once established, the arc had much higher resistance than the shorted capacitor, and didn't trip the power supply's short-detection system.\n\n6) The intense heat from the arc burned through to the other side of the board (photo #5), but didn't start a fire because circuit boards are required to be made of a flame-resistant laminate in order to get CE (UL) approval.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FR-4\n\n7) Eventually, something on the other side of the card would have melted together, creating another short. This would have tripped the power supply's short-circuit detection and cut the power, bringing the show to an end.\n\n\nWe had a failure like this on one of our mining cards as well, but it was due to flux residue on the card causing a bad connection in the PCI slot. It destroyed the card and the motherboard in quite a spectacular fashion.\n\nSince we'd bought roughly twenty of these cards from HIS, we emailed them the photos. It took a month of going back and forth, but eventually they paid for a new motherboard and sent us a top-of-the-line video card worth twice as much as the one that failed.\n\nThe card manufacturer is really in a \"no win\" position on this one.

I could use a generic block to cool the core and cool the memory with heat-fins, but that option seems a bit hit-or-miss to me.  This will cost around $450 (I have some of the water-cooling components already).  \n    \nAnother option I am considering, and the one I am leaning towards, is an [oil submersion rig](http://www.pugetsystems.com/aquarium-computer.php).

The ones that are sandwiched will overheat. The cards should thermal throttle (13.1 drivers), where after 97C they will throttle down to about 500mhz briefly and go up and down to prevent thermal overload. This is probably the stuttering issue you see in reviews that people complain about. Thermal throttled one averages at best 475-500mh/s instead of 700ish mh/s.\n\nRunning one of the 2 cards I have at the thermal limit, which admittedly is unwise, but XFX has a lifetime warranty and which why I got them at all.\n\nMy current plan is to run the middle card outside of the case (giving air flow space for the top card), and hanging or resting it on a milk/soda crate or something, using 1 or 2 PCI-E riser extension cables, possibly daisy chained. PCI-E riser cables seem pretty hit or miss, so we'll see. Getting mine from DealExtreme, should be here in ~2 weeks. You can get some from Cablesaurus or US ebay, but they will cost $20ish instead of $7. \n\nCableSaurus also has the ones with power molex connectors. The molex is necessary if you are doing a 5-6 card setup on one motherboard, or if your PCI-E riser cable isnt alllowing enough/any power from the mobo to the graphics card (depends on the cable). Either way, those ones are about $20 each.\n\nI've also noticed, from Newegg reviews, XFX responding that they would in some cases, allow an exchange of a 7970 for one with a reference cooler (no idea if it means you actually get a reference version of the card, or if its just the cooler).

In digging around after the fact I found several people saying that the VRM's aren't cooled nearly as well as on the stock Radeon 7970, and from my personal experience I can say that the airflow direction was going the wrong way for my setup.  I have a Corsair H100i which was originally pulling cool air into the case, and a large case fan on the front pulling air in also, with a 120mm exhaust fan at the rear, with the XFX also pulling air into the case it was too much coming in and not enough going out.  I reversed the H100i fans so they blew out of the case but the card would still run WAY too hot, and even at 100% fan speed.  This didn't jive with what other people were getting from other cards (mid to low 70's at 85% or less fan speed) so I decided to RMA the board and get a Gigabyte 3 fan 7970 instead.

So on my Gigabyte board I can't increase the volts at all, which is a real shame as I could get a much better overclock I'm sure than my max of 1125Mhz...

Pool-hopping is then the exploitation of this circumstance by mining only when the attractiveness is high and leaving when the attractiveness is low. This damages the overall attractiveness for participants who mine continuously.\nContinuously mining in a hoppable pool is thus clearly disadvantageous; but a scenario where everyone optimally pool-hops is also not sustainable. Any hoppable pool will even- tually reach a state when it is less attractive than hopping-proof pools; when this happens everyone will stop mining there, and it will forever remain in this state. The only sustainable system is one where everyone mines solo or at a pool which is hopping-proof, or at least very highly hopping-resistant.\n\nThe traditional form of hopping is to exploit the higher expected reward for mining in young rounds in pools which use the proportional method, and to a lesser extent, slush\u2019s method. This was discussed in section 2.1 and Appendix B.\n\nHopping can also be done in pools which base payments on some sort of bu\ufb00er. Generally, the lower the bu\ufb00er, the less attractive it is to participate. In SMPPS, for example, pool- hoppers can reduce their maturity time by mining only when the bu\ufb00er is positive.\nIn some naive score-based methods which take temporal factors (rather than only shares and blocks submitted) into consideration in determining a share\u2019s score, it is possible to pool- hop based on \ufb02uctuations in the pool\u2019s hashrate. Generally, it is more pro\ufb01table to mine when the pool\u2019s current hashrate is higher than average. This is analyzed in Appendix G.\n", 1], ["2013-04-11 08:04:22", "I noticed that Slush's churns namecoins at the same time as Bitcoin, without any loss in the BTC department.

But let me give you a disclaimer before I put in my two cents.. I have purchased a miner, but yet to get it in - so I am not experienced other than my research. I am going purley off calculators, promises from Bitmain (and their reviewrs), various YouTube videos, and many blogs. And please - if I am wrong, someone correct me. I do not want to lead this person down the wrong path on accident. \n\nI did quite a bit of my calculations on NiceHash. They have a calculator that shows the current ROI (return on investment) that people are getting from mining through them. You choose your equipment and click calculate. They calculate the average based on what people are getting from their equipment at current speed, what they made in the last 24 hours, week, month, and expected yearly. \n\nhttps://www.nicehash.com/?p=calc\n\nCurrent calculations (with default elec costs) (per day):\nAntminer S9: 13.72 USD\nAntminer L3+: 29.63 USD\nAntMiner D3: Not yet on there\n\nWith NiceHash, you are not mining directly for coins. You are actually selling your hashing power to buyers so they can mine with whatever coin they want and in turn, nicehash pays you that in bitcoins. From the math I have done over the past few months, NiceHash is the most profitable way to mine. Keep in mind this is not taking into account heating/cooling/electrician/upkeep/etc.\n\nNow to getting a miner.. \nWhen I first looked into this, I had 0 luck getting a miner. And I was worried about the fact I don't have 220v lines and would have to run one just for the miner. I was also concerned about heating and cooling and possible fires from so much elec. Bitmain's site kept crashing when I went to buy one and was sold out when it came back. I bought mine from a well known hosting company based out of Switzerland. You can either get it shipped to you or they host it for not much over what elec costs are showing up in the default nicehash calc. \n\nhttps://shop.cloudsigma.com/?tap_a=23299-1215bf&tap_s=159937-875827\n\nRight now, they only have L3+, but they do stock the other ones usually after bitmain has their sale. I would say be very cautios about ordering from companies other than bitmain. But this one appears to be a legit business with good reviews. I would have trouble buying from a guy that swears to have 10 up for sale on social media, just because of the amount of money. But that is up to you. \n\nA lot of people scream unprofitable in two months. Might be true.. But I looked into it L3+ months ago and was talked out of getting one. Profit was $1800 / month then when they said in two months there would be 0 profit and in the hole. 3 months later still at $1500, and 5 months later, down to $1200, but still very good profit. You are taking a gamble. It takes about 2-3 months to even get the miner in. \n\nI would say do your math carefully. Take advantage of calculators, and don't invest more than you can afford to loose. Make sure you understand what mining actually is. Watch a lot of YouTube videos (although they are not always accurate, and become out of date very quickly). \n\nGood luck to you and keep us updated on your endeavours!", 6], ["2017-09-12 17:42:20", "A LOT of information I found on Cryptos in general at [https://bitcointalk.org/](https://bitcointalk.org/)\n\nYou need some fundamental understanding, so I'd suggest searching for videos on \"what is bitcoin\" or \"what are cryptocurrencies\" - lots of good high level overviews. I believe scishow had a good one on youtube.\n\nAfter that you can find lots of mining discussions on bitcointalk and other forums. I suggest reading - a lot of reading and trying to dive deep on terms you don't understand. \n\nSome basics: \nDifferent cryptocurrencies work differently. Bitcoin and others use \"proof of work\" or PoW, which means that \"miners\" are needed to do some work for the network in order to validate transactions and approve new \"blocks\". Miners are rewarded for this work, and generally this is the only instance where new units of the given currency is created. The amount of currency rewards issued per block is a set number, meaning that the more miners do this work, the less units (or fractions of a unit) each one of them will get. Additionally, the rate of work you do is generally measured in hashes per second (a hash is a mathematical function you do as the form of work for the network) - your rate of work is proportional to the likelihood of you finding the next correct block in the chain (and getting the reward for it).

But it has ultimately been very beneficial for mining, especially those miners in the bottom half of the hashrate range. Pooled mining probably encourages more distributed mining (in terms of hardware) than would exist without them. If I have 5Gh/s and can mine in a pool and earn something, that sounds a lot better than just running the machine indefinitely hoping to find a block which, although would pay handsomely, may or may not ever happen. So I'd be more likely to just shut the thing off, which regardless of speed is bad for distributed hashing.\n\nI think the best argument is that it is giving these pool operators too much power in a system built on requiring little or no trust (although I understand that pool mining does require some trust). This is now essentially two people who have control over half the network hashrate. Even if they can't or don't perform a 51% attack, there is nothing preventing them from working together to change *something*... whatever that may be... and have half of the mining power follow them blindly until someone caught it. If there is a disagreement on a future change, instead of the majority ruling it could essentially come down to two people until miners who actually follow what is going on jumped ship.\n\nIf you're mining on one of these pools, why not switch? Do you think you're earning more? I know Ghash.IO does their own thing with cex.io, but there are plenty of pools where you would earn just as much as these two.\n\nIf you're a miner you should at least be willing to do something as simple as switching pools if it means there is less risk. Not that I think BTC Guild or Ghash.IO would attempt to do anything bad... after all, they're miners too and would be destroying the value of their own coins.

Independent GPUs will still have a massive amount of stream processors in comparison to CPUs.\n\nThis article is dealing with CPU/GPU having direct access to the same memory, something that when it comes to bitcoin mining, we tend to ignore (I'm basing this off of the fact that we downclock the memory clock in order to reduce temperatures without affecting hash rates).\n\n---\n\nSomeone with more experience should edit my reasoning and conclusions, but the tl;dr answer is no.", 2], ["2013-05-01 17:41:28", "This type of hardware promotes the ability to share large chunks of 2d or 3d data between the CPU and GPU easily. You are exactly right with what you said about AMD using this to utilize GPU's parallel processing and at the same time running CPU running some less parallel computation on less threads. However, this is already achievable with current generation hardware (current GPU's and CPU's) with current generation GPU focused heterogeneous programming models (OpenCL and Cuda).\n\nWith current generation GPU's (in most cases) to offload a chunk of work to the GPU for processing, the data must be copied down the bus to the device by the runtime system of the programming/execution model you are using. Very simply, the larger the data you need to copy, and/or the more frequent you need to do so, the more the bus becomes the bottle-neck. The types of applications that need to repeatedly copy large amounts of data between CPU and GPU are usually 3d applications like games or GPGPU applications with a very, very large streaming data set.\n\nYou mentioned that memory tends to be something we ignore in bitcoin mining because it's usually down-clocked to reduce heat. Yes, exactly right, and the reason it's done is because bitcoin mining is significantly more compute bound, than memory bound. Also, while some data has to be transferred between the CPU and the GPU for bitcoin mining, it does not need to happen very quickly or very often and that suitable chunks can be copied without straining the bus.\n\nSo I doubt it will impact bitcoing mining in any way, and as others have said, ASICs will make sure of it.\n", 2], ["2013-05-01 07:00:57", "Rendered moot by the fact that GPUs will be irrelevant in terms of mining anyway, due to ASIC proliferation.", 2], ["2013-05-01 13:04:14", "Nope.\n\n*Especially* not since the advent of ASICs.", 1], ["2013-05-02 09:42:09", "Seems to me, if I were AMD - I'd tell the lab to start building GPUs just for the mining market.

I'm not sure that hUMA will affect either currency's mining methods.\n\nScrypt was developed so that memory usage would increase the faster you work AND that the less memory you had would result in slower work.  The algorithm uses a large pseudo random data set in order to derive the key.  Each element can be generated individually, but this is very computationally expensive.\n\nThe work required still benefits heavily from parallel processing.  Thus, graphics cards that already have direct access to their faster-than-DDR3 memory (GDDR5) will not benifit from hUMA.  The CPU in an independent CPU/GPU configuration will not benefit greatly because it has a slow enough work speed that it is not limited by memory to the extend the GPU is limited.\n\nWhen it comes to APUs implementing hUMA is where I cannot give much in terms of opinions.  L1,L2,L3 cache is much faster than GDDR5 but at the cost of much smaller storage sizes, but I do not know the feasibility of putting the scrypt dataset in one of these caches, the toll it would take on the system, or even how much the GPU of the APU would benifit.", 1], ["2013-05-01 19:27:02", "This is /r/bitcoinmining.

However,\n\n>Thus, perhaps part of the 10x speedup comes not from the GPUs' computing power, but rather from GPU cards' memory subsystem being on par with or faster than CPUs' L2 cache for scrypt's access pattern (entire cache lines being requested) and from the greater concurrency of such accesses.\n\nThis would contradict my earlier statement that L2 cache is faster than GDDR5.  However, I still think that the advantage of parallel processing on the GPU is of bigger impact than that of memory speeds.\n\nTweaking the memory usage of the litecoin scrypt settings would be interesting to see.  I assume that 128KB is not the maximum size of the dataset that scrypt could generate.  Why limit it to the L2 cache when you could just use the 32 to 64 GB (surely the dataset isn't that large) of DDR3 some people have or the 3 to 6GB of GDDR5 on the GPU?  Shouldn't storing the entire scrypt dataset would be worth using the slower memory, and if GDDR5 is faster than L2 for scrypt's purposes, why limit it to 128KB?

You'll still need to buy more expensive receptacles, 2 pull breakers, cord ends, and 4 wire cable vs 3 wire cable if you're building cords. At a 5-7% improvement it could still be worth looking into. It's not as simple as picking up some red #12 and running a circuit when you live in a condo, or don't have access into wall spaces. \n\nEverything in the code book discussing overcurrent protection talks about load which directly relates to heat. Table 2 discusses conductors in a specific ambient temp, directs you to table 5A if temps are higher, and also sends you to a rule that discusses loading again. If you're worried about volt drop you increase the wire size, but the size of the over current protection remains the same given load. They are to prevent people from heating up a wire with too much load. Combine an overloaded circuit condition with inexperience people (or a bad initial installation) who may not make a proper connection when doing their own electrical and the consequence could be severe. Given that hobby miners rooms are hot as hell (from what I'm hearing around the forums), and many of them are loading non-dedicated circuits relying on a breaker to trip; giving them some general advice to bring their systems closer to what the code tells them is probably sound advice. I wouldn't have claimed to be offering incredibly technical information here, I'm a tradesman after all, not an engineer.\n\nTo elaborate...\n\nFlip to CEC 8-104 (5)(a) a 15A breaker rated for 80% loading, protecting a Wire NMD90, 14 /2, maximum loading shall be based on a table 2.\n\nFlip to Table 2 gives the allowable ampacity of 14awg but in small print at the bottom of the table sends you to rule 14-104, and to table 5A where ambient temps are above 30C for correction factors which will lessen the allowable ampacity on the conductor the hotter the temp is at 5C intervals. \n\nFlip to Rule 14-104 overrides all.

Testing was simple:\nSplit the outer sheathing of a 5-15 to C13 power cord to expose the 3 inside wires, and put a clamp ammeter around the the hot or neutral.  For a load I used a altcoin (eth) mining rig providing a fixed DC load of about 50% of the PSU rating, where most PSUs get their peak efficiency.  Used another meter to measure the exact voltage (around here 120-123V is typical).   Did the same thing for 240, as I have both 240 and 120V outlets in my workshop.\nYou also don't need special plugs.  Standard NEMA 5-15 receptacles are fine at 300V, as are the power cords.  Although you don't often see 5-15 supplying 220-240V, plugs that accept a 1-15 polarized plug to provide 220V can be found in many countries such as Brazil.\nI did write \"240V!\" in marker on the plate cover just in case a friend/neighbor is in my workshop when I'm not around and is looking for someplace to plug in an AC power tool such as a drill or table saw.\n\nAs for your code citations regarding heat, it seems you don't get that code was made years ago so school drop-outs with a grade-8 education could work in a trade while not putting (other) people's lives at risk.  I'm talking about people who need a calculator to work out P=I^2*R, and have little hope of calculating resistance given voltage drop and current.\nSo if the code says that 12A on 14AWG inside a drywall-clad wall (i.e. little convective cooling) in a 35C boiler room is going to get over 90C, it's WRONG.  Calculate the power dissipation in the wire, the thermal resistance of the sheathing and the surrounding air (typically measured in C/W), and I'd bet a case of beer you'll get a number around 60C, or 25C above ambient.\n\nNow the folks at CSA, NRCan, & CMHC aren't idiots, but they tend to assume the trades reading the code are idiots.  So you'll probably find a note somewhere in the code or an appendix that says the heat de-rating tables are based on a bundle of 10 or so wires, like you *could* get when a lazy-ass electrician can't find his recip saw, and so borrows the plumber's 2\" hole saw to cut into the bottom plate of an inside wall and stuffs all the upstairs branch circuits from the panel into the 2\" hole.\nYet even that is unlikely to be a fire hazard.  You'd probably have to tie-strap the the bundle of wires together for the full height of the wall in order to get enough contained heat to make a fire hazard.\n\np.s.

For people who only have 2-15 ghash of mining power in ASICs, they are quickly finding out that its more profitable to mine scrypt with a video card and convert to BTC. Sites such as Middlecoin do this for you, taking out all the guesswork of what to mine.\n\nTo give you guys an example, I have 6 USB ASIC miners which consistently pull 2 Ghash/s. They mine 24/7 and I pull in around .01 BTC every 11-13 days.\n\nI also mine with a 660ti via cudaminer. I have it configured to pull around 200 khash/s. This card mines around 16 hours a day. Every 5-6 days, I pull in .01-.02 BTC after conversions. (I use the middlecoin pool).\n\nDoing quick math, it pulls in around 2X as much, assuming I only pull in .01 BTC via my 660ti for 5-6 days. This doesn't take into account that 1/3 of the day I do not mine (It's my home computer, I typically listen to music and have it running other things while i'm at home).\n\nJust from looking at this one small example, you can start to see why video card prices are higher..

You could have participated in a group buy and instead put only $400 to buy 1/10th of the shares of a unit, though you are at the whim of the original buyer.\n\nRegarding to KNCminer being a scam, I did a write up as well as a few others about the possibility of it being a scam: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1g0yvf/feathercoin_going_through_a_real_51_attack_people/cafpzm9\n\nThere is also a thread on bitcointalk somewhere about the same thing, but it was found that it is likely they are using Altera's HardCopy 5 service, which is a very simple FPGA to ASIC conversion for the most part. The manufacturing and design costs are much cheaper due to this, so they need even less capital to get this going.\n\nBitcoins plummet to a very low value is always a risk that you must be willing to endure. As we know, it is very volatile, but with the recent venture capital flowing into the bitcoin ecosystem resulting in a better infrastructure and services, it is unlikely that it will plummet to very low prices. I personally am throwing this number out of my ass, but I feel that the chances of it falling below the recent \"collapse\" from $266 to $56 is the lowest it will go.\n\nWith regards to KNCminer, here is the thinking you should do. What was the opportunity cost for that four grand, assuming it is not a scam? Do you know of a investment which would have given you a worthy amount of money during the two and a half wait to get your unit? Then you need to consider what the ROI will be for the miner. Do you expect to get a return in a reasonable amount of time? My ROI time frame for bitcoin miners, considering the risk bitcoin itself has, would be three months at most. So, how high will the difficulty be by that time? Sadly we do not really know, and it is very dependent on how ASIC's move around during these next few weeks with BFL, Avalon ASIC group buys, BitFury, and if AsicMiner has anything else up their sleeves.\n\nFor me, 4,000 seems like too much of a risk, especially when you have to wait two months, and those two months are during the Asic revolution. But, in the worst case scenario your miner will still be probably profitable to run regardless for a few more months, so you might be able to get at least 1 grand on ebay for it. You can also possibly sell your pre order on ebay or elsewhere if you change your mind, and instead put your money into buying shares of AsicMiner, mining bonds, or participating in a group buy.

This results in lame ASIC performance, but since they are using a smaller feature size they can get around it by just throwing more SHA blocks at it for faster hashing.\n\nIt is interesting why none of the other ASIC vendors seem to be doing this, since it results in a much faster time frame but slower preformance.", 1], ["2013-06-11 23:17:59", "I had three orders with bASIC I believe, two paid by bank transfer and one by bitcoin.
