But then CFB started claiming that the vulnerability was intentional to harm forks of their project.\n\nThat is either\n\n1. A bad excuse to an embarrassing vulnerability, or\n\n2. Spitting in the face of the free and open source software community.\n\nNick is completely correct when he says that if copycats were a concern, they could keep the source closed, or use a restrictive license.

It also shows enormous lack of faith in their own implementation, if they're scared an outside team could improve their platform and do better than them.\n\nAnd unfortunately, the IOTA community downplays the importance of this point, and downvotes anyone who dares doubt CFB's \"genius.\"", 32], ["2017-09-27 01:42:58", "I have some of the same concerns as Nick...

Ethereum and Iota are not rivals. Let's not create one.\n\n----\n\n> I have nothing against the IOTA community, or DAG algorithms. I strongly disagree with many of IOTA's technical decisions (trinary, custom hash functions, POW on transactions), and find some of their behavior deeply egregious to the point where it goes beyond mere negligence. The \"security flaw as copy protection\" thing is particularly offensive, and makes it difficult to trust the current dev team.\n\n> Here are some examples of things that I would encourage the IOTA community to do, and I'd be happy to support IOTA if many of these things were to happen:\n\n> * Work with academic researchers on making the tangle algorithm something that has provable formal security guarantees.  I personally would highly recommend Aviv Zohar; he has worked on DAG algorithms with GHOST and SPECTER and could be great at suggesting improvements (I see you have cited him in your paper already; great)\n* Abandon trinary. Yes, I get it, (log(3)/log(2)) / (3/2) ~= 1.06 and balanced ternary is cool, but if it's all ultimately running in binary hardware you're not making any gains. And even on trinary hardware in the future, 6% is negligible, and there's little value for negative numbers in a cryptocurrency. Just use SHA256, SHA3, Blake, anything (and no, [this](https://reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/70ya29/time_for_a_paradigm_shift_has_come/) is not an excuse either).\n* Permanently disavow the use of security flaws as copy protection.\n* Do a full comprehensive security audit, so third parties can verify that such \"copy protection\", as well as unintentional flaws, no longer exist.\n* Formalize tangle's scalability claims in a similar way as we did here https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ for ethereum, and show how tangle can be secure in a world where every user processes only a small portion of all transactions.\n* Address the issue that legitimate users of the system will be generally producing PoW on consumer hardware or devices with power constraints, whereas attackers will have access to specialized hardware, creating a large advantage in favor of the attacker.\n* Formalize mathematical bounds on the level of influence that the \"coordinator\" can have on consensus, and show that this level of influence becomes negligible once IOTA has enough transaction volume to be self-sustaining.\n\n> Also, I would make a personal appeal to IOTA to not fear copycats. Ethereum did not. You have the opportunity to create a strong brand around specializing in DAG blockchain tech, especially if you can welcome existing researchers in such algorithms. If you have this, then copycats will only be a shadow of what you can accomplish.", 9], ["2017-09-27 02:32:19", "They are non concerns.

This was not news to anyone following the IOTA development but it was used as an attack piece that was baseless. Not only were many of those actors behind that attack biased with direct ties to IOTA competitors they ended up back peddling on their claims. All this can be found in CFB's email trail with the MIT team and the conflicts of interest are all there to see.

List goes on and on.

(Same time this \"exploit\" was patched up long before the FUD article)\n\nhttps://blog.iota.org/upgrades-updates-d12145e381eb\n\nSo now that we know this was not something hidden from people and was actively mentioned in blog posts by the dev team what does the FUD article have to stand on? Fast forward to todays post bringing up AGAIN almost a month later the same FUD.\n\nThe timing of this lining up again almost to the day as the same FUD article as last month with positive IOTA news like the new Flash Network technology up and running. The new partnership with a new Crypto Smart Phone and more.\n\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2017/09/26/blockchain-smartphone-sirin-finney-solarin/\n\nThen the point of IOTA choosing ternary instead of binary being a bad decision. That is an odd thing to say, we all know technology is advancing forward, quantum computing and more so the IOTA developers chose to look ahead and prepare the base development of their system on this future we all know is coming. Nothing wrong with emulating on binary but building your foundation on the future. This is the whole point of JINN Labs (The hardware side of IOTA) developing Ternary hardware with large chip manufacturers.\n\nIf you want to understand the technicals behind why Ternary listen to this talk behind one of the JINN lab developers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJMtJq20NY&t=193s\n\nPeople seem to forget IOTA is just the software side of a two pronged project developing alongside the hardware aspect. If a developer looking into the future and trying to pave this path forward is a bad thing then I dont know what to say. Someone has to do the risky pioneer work otherwise we wouldn't get anywhere.\n\nAs for his final point regarding CFB's hidden traps in the IOTA code. This is a defensive measure taken to protect the USERS. The guy is a literal genius and this was a wise move to protect people from being scammed with IOTA copycats. Let me give you an example of this already happening.\n\nThere is a copycat IOTA right now, (literally a copy paste of code) that is a TOTAL scam by the creator, has ties to Panama Banking shell companies and more. CFB did this to protect against scam coins who don't do the basic inspection of the code. If they did not bother to do the work to make sure these loopholes were closed they were not a competent team and should not be scamming naive investors.\n\nHere is a link covering the shady side of one of the IOTA copycats.\nhttps://steemit.com/iota/@rajivshah/adk-exposed\n\nThis is EXACTLY what that protection is for, its to protect not only the IOTA investors but also prevent scam projects with no technical knowledge from robbing investors blind.\n\nLike I said this article is very fishy but it is what it is. I dont blame the IOTA community for being angry lately because it is literally attacked every other day by countless trolls, fud articles, literal attacks on the network (they all have failed) and even active censorship including this /r/cryptocurrency Reddit group just 2 days ago.\n\nThe technology behind IOTA can help other blockchains and in the end the users but it receives a lot of unjustified hatred so of course the community is a tad on edge. To now see Ethereum developers repeating the same FUD from last month is a tad disheartening considering many IOTA holders also hold ETH and believe that both projects can further advance the world of distributed ledgers.", -9], ["2017-09-28 02:12:55", "Before I load up, does Nick Johnson post here?\n\nAnybody know?\n\nAlso, what are his thoughts on on Bitcoin in general?\n\n", -4], ["2017-09-27 03:20:09", "And there are other DLTs designed for IOT systems... people seem fixated on IOTA as 'the only way'... clearly it isn't but it does get all the press,hype and shilling", 8], ["2017-09-27 03:23:08", "I want to follow this up with this: I am an academic research scientist, so part of my core philosophy is to share my work openly with the global community.

I'm feeling a little bit bearish, and I can't quite put my finger on why, it is more of a feeling from trading bitcoin a long time when mining profitability is this high. At the current inflation rate and prices we are getting about $7 million dollars a day in fresh coins, and in times of lull I always feel like that will have downward pressure on the price. Historically after a big rise in crypto where mining is profitable, things get bearish if new buyers aren't entering the market like crazy. When you consider how many ETH there are and how much of that is illiquid, $50 million dollars of inflation a week is a lot for the bulls to handle, if we hit $400-500 in the short term, the problem gets worse. Honestly, if we can just go sideways and hold this price point as the mining difficulty climbs, that will be impressive to me.\nIt is a funny phenomenon, but something that I've noticed in bitcoin land, is that a few months after people start shutting off their miners saying \"f-- this, it costs so much more to mine than it does to just buy the currency\", and like magic, the next bull-run starts.\nObviously this mid-term view probably shouldn't play a large role in our next movement, but when the price is significantly higher than it was a short time ago, miners will just keep trying to frontload paying off their mining rigs, because a lot of them have this sort of \"Well, once i sell like 6 coins, my rig will be paid off, then I can hodl\".\nI did the same thing with bitcoin, then again with litecoin, and although I don't live in a place condusive to mining ETH, and I'm a little older without the pressure of feeling like I need to pay myself back a bit for purchases in the $1500 range (I can thank Magic cards for that, they have desensitized me to expensive hobbies) I imagine others are doing the same.\nAnd even the sentiment in the ethtrader sub isn't FOMOing. So where is the FOMO? Can a Bull explain to me why we should retest new highs? Trading this stuff is fun, but if I'm not currently in a long position or have a stack in cold storage, do you still feel like ETH is a good deal in the short term?

In a year, the ecosystem will be thriving well beyond anything we can probably conceive of right now.  Keep in mind big corporations have the chance to offer tokens, too- not so much as a kickstarter in concept, but more as a requirement for any service or good they may implement on the Ethereum blockchain.  Even if this Mystical Fortune 500 Token^TM is used in the back-end of whatever these companies develop, the equivalent exchange in ETH will still be occurring.\n\nLooking at the 4 hr chart, log scale, There is a clear channel that ETH has stayed within since February/March.  Every time we have touched the bottom of that channel, we have bounced hard as fuck and I think this time is no exception.  Not even the panic sell off/correction (however you want to see it) after the GDAX flash crash incident could knock us out of this channel.  The fireworks in July won't start until maybe the 7th at the very earliest, but it's gonna be amazing and I really think all the gloating bears will be caught with their pants down.  \n\nI also am VERY interested to see if there is any weight to the possibility that getting an average of the angles at which we've bounced off the bottom line and started our legs up can provide any insight to the angle of our next leg up.

There's already a few clean forks of bitcoin (LTC itself was a fork right?) and *that's* the proper approach, which has been the way open source software projects have worked for as long as I can remember.

Right out of the starting gate what they're doing is dishonest and I don't like it. The whole point to being open source is that if you don't like it, fork it and make your own. Not: kick the original developers out and take over the original project.\n\nI guess I don't care if they think their goals are rationale if their means of getting there is dishonest and to be frank, kind of dirty.\n\nCommandeering someone elses open source project is just not the right way to go about things.

I will answer everyone's questions within this response:\n\n/u/talkingbob :\n>what do you see that a financial advisor would bring to the table for you?\n\nFirst and foremost, I need tax guidance.  I know this coming tax season I will be on the hook for a fair bit of taxes, and I am not interested in fucking this up. I want to start getting this issue tackled before heading into winter. \n\nSecondly, my understanding of traditional investing avenues are quite limited. I know that I don't know a lot in this sector.  I ideally would like some traditional advice on planning for my retirement. I know there is probably options out there that would mitigate some tax implications, but then again, I don't know much, and I could be very wrong.  And I am not interested in the penalties for being wrong. \n\n/u/calm_thoughts :\n>if you can manage the extreme volatility & risk of crypto-markets trading and walk away with lots of profit you are probably in the top 0.1% of all investors, maybe the top 0.01%\n\nI wouldn't consider myself a day trader. I definitely do manage the extreme volatility and risk well. I've made my mistakes early, learned the lessons fast, and I managed to keep the cost of those lessons <1000$ USD.  I feel that I am an excellent trader of opportunity. I only trade projects I have a deep understanding of, that I feel will have valuable applications in the future.  I only buy low and sell high with these bets, I trade based on %'s, I remove the emotion.  If that token takes a beating, I hold and buy more.  When it sky-rockets, I sell 10-20% on 2 Fibonacci tiers. Then wait for the inevitable dip, then buy some more.   \n\n>You may be better-served to just step away from the high-speed high-intensity mental zone of crypto trading & relax into various traditional investment-management texts. All that stuff is luxuriously slow and really quite easy compared to trying to juggle the complexity of crypto markets.\n\nI am starting to think I should at least pull a % of my gains out and start down the path of some safer traditional investment plans.  At a certain point, I am worried I am being greedy by having all my eggs in the crypto basket. \n\n> was referring to gonopro, assuming he is walking away with 4-digit-percent (or more?) gains.\nI'm not sure by my sense from your posting history is that you are not at that level of gains. (Nor am I, I might add. Merely 250-275% here.) Correct me if I'm wrong of course.\n\nEconomics and math have never been my strong suit, I gave up on math in 10th grade, 15 years ago.  So getting into crypto last year, I knocked the cobwebs off, and have been learning as much as I can. I am confident that my spreadsheet is within the ballpark of being reasonably correct. \n\nThat being said, my calculations are putting me at a 3200% profit, and my AVG cost is somewhere in the mid teens.  \n\nAnd to segue into /u/LongFaced point:\n>I'm in a similar position as bob with a profit percentage I never dreamed of. Which is phenomenal and I am very happy with it, but like bob I invested an amount I could afford to lose, which hasn't amounted to an amount that is majorly life changing for me.\n\nThis always has been a venture with money I was willing to lose.  I am young, single, and incredibly resourceful. Yes my initial investment would be a lot of money to many people, but I also manage my money very well, and it wouldn't even come close to ruining me if it were to disappear. \n\nI've pulled maybe 5% of the initial to pay some bills and do some minor upgrades on my truck. I also pulled out another % of the initial investment and divided it up among FCT/REP/GNT, respectively.\n\nBut my long term goal, why I am so hesitant to pull any money out. I want to keep my ETH pile as large as possible for when I am able to stake. \n\nI also put all of this money down last year with the intent being a 5 year investment minimum. I wasn't expecting to have to be making any of these decisions just over a year later, frankly I wasn't prepared for a meteoric rise this soon. \n\nAnother point by /u/talkingbob:\n>I was among the very bullish for $1000 ETH by August, until the price shot on up past $280. The warning signal for me has been that nobody here among us regulars in the trading forums seriously expected $250+ ETH in early June. Those targets were late June/early July/maybe August.\n\nI share these thoughts. But I feel I am reasonable in my position that a perfect storm is brewing for this summer.  All of the on-ramps for FIAT are clogged coming in, Shapeshift is stating they are experiencing a one way exodus of BTC -> ETH, August 1st, the inertia that the EEA is coalescing, many of the flippening metrics have trigger and finally, the FOMO that is starting to bubble over with people who are now just starting to take crypto seriously. \n\n My far from educated guess, we could blow well past 1000USD in the next few months(because all of our most reasonable guesses up to this point have been absolutely destroyed), but if that type of explosion happens, I don't foresee it being sustainable.  I am trying to come up with a plan for this type of event.  Wether or not it happens, really doesn't affect my long term goal for wanting to stake heavily.\n\n\nTo close out this long post, here is another thing I am planning for, and not sure how to do it properly.  This has been posted a few times in the last week, but it is very relevant to me. [I am now in a position of fuck you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdfeXqHFmPI), to quote myself from a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtraderpro/comments/6fkuyl/eth_pro_daily_discussion_june_06_2017/dism71s/) a few days ago. (I added a few more sentiments inside of this quote)\n>I am a bartender and I've been on a slow healing path for over 8 months recovering from a herniated L5 disk from double stacking kegs. I woke up every day at a pain level from 5-8 for 7 months, with no end in sight. Waking up everyday in excruciating pain will whittle away your will to be alive. Not only did I spend significant energy fighting the pain, but I had to spend equal amount of energy to be my normal happy and compassionate self. It wasn't acceptable to take my pain out on others.\n\n>I work in a mountain resort town, and I get a break from work during the spring off-season. During this time off I was able to get on oral steroids and do physical therapy. I have been pain free for over a month without surgery.\n\n>I had my first shift behind the bar on Saturday, and the pain returned within an hour. I informed the newly hired GM about my pain, he told me to suck it up.\n\n>Want to take a guess what my response was?\n\n>I've decided to permanently hang my hat as a professional bartender. I will deeply miss this profession, but I am no longer willing to break my body for this job; nor will I be talked to like that.\n\n>I am now searching for jobs in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nNow that I am unemployed indefinitely. I am trying to come up with a plan for what I want to pursue, and how to achieve that. I am considering going on an extended global wander. But nothing is set in stone, other than I will have to start working again before the year is over.  I really hope to find employment within Ethereum somewhere.

The implication is that average velocities can and are likely to be high\n\nIt makes no sense that monetary velocity would be high just because it's all running on computers. The fiat world mostly runs on computers too.\n\n> the cost of using decentralised protocols is deflationary, since the cost of processing power, storage and bandwidth are deflationary\n\nYes but transaction costs are a small portion of Ethereum's GDP.\n\n> Use cases will be limited [due to cost]\n\nJust a failure of imagination here, I'd say. Also a lack of understanding of scaling solutions.\n\n> The ability to fork protocols maximises utility for users but suppresses economic rent for token holders\n\nBecause Bitcoin's forks really depressed the BTC price, right? He continues this argument later, saying that proof of work is somehow a defense against forking, and proof of stake tokens will go to minimal value because they're trivially forked. I think in practice we'll find that's not the case at all, because network effects really do matter. \n\n>  an aggressive group of forking developers could reallocate the foundation\u2019s tokens to their own new entity in their fork\n\nIt's hilarious that he thinks that fork would attract users.\n\n> Ethereum could serve as the backbone for processing smart contract operations for (hopefully) untold numbers of decentralised applications, DAOs, etc., and perhaps one day maybe even something like the fabled Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \n\nFabled?

He ignores that ETH is used as money for lots of other things, like ICO contributions, gambling, ENS registrations, straight-up payments, etc. (His calculation does show why it was smart to ignore all the people claiming ETH was just a fuel, not a currency.)\n\nHe also argues that because PoS will reduce security costs, it will reduce ETH value. I don't think this makes sense because mining expense is a consequence of coin price, not the other way around.\n\nFrom footnote 20:\n\n> At that point it will matter not whether you use Ether, Bitcoin or any other token \u2014 all will work equally well.\n\nExcept that Bitcoin can do 3 tx/sec and has no smart contracts.\n\nHe starts to reveal his bias here, comparing Ethereum with Bitcoin:\n\n> a more complex protocol with a larger attack surface, shorter track record, less decentralised governance and propensity to make backwards incompatible protocol changes, for a hugely robust, stable, proven, and widely accepted protocol that already performs that narrow function very well\n\nThe weakness of Bitcoin will be more apparent when Ethereum's transaction capacity increases by 100X this year.

For most protocols, such incentives are heavily front-ended around launch and insufficiently provided for over time. The more ambitious and long-term a protocol\u2019s development roadmap is, the more problematic this failure of incentives becomes. The incentives to improve an existing protocol by forking it may be strong if some tokens are reallocated at the fork to the developers making the improvements. For example, where tokens have been retained by a foundation linked to the original protocol developers, an aggressive group of forking developers could reallocate the foundation\u2019s tokens to their own new entity in their fork, leaving all other users in the same position and letting the market decide which fork to support. The incentives for a developer to create a new, competing protocol are also strong, but network effects do make it harder to displace an existing protocol than to improve or fork it.\n\nSay it with me:Forking a chain doesn't [doesn't automatically give you what you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs).\n\nNow for Ethereum...\n\n> There is no reason for this to be the case in an industry where capacity can be freely added and withdrawn and the market price freely set.\n\n\nYeah fam, supply for GPUs is clearly perfectly elastic, and the time necessary to spin up (and down) farms is insignificant. \n\n> But let\u2019s first agree that because of the GASPRICE mechanism14 the volume of transactions on the ETH blockchain and the scale of its adoption are not transitive to a high ETH token value.\n\nNo they're not, but the do have a great effect on liquidity (and thus scarcity).\n\n>  If we assume an ETH velocity of 7\n\nWhy not five?

Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature (i.e. ETH/fiat Jan-June). The more mature the trend, the less chance that the pattern marks a continuation or the less upside potential.\n\nCup: The cup should be \u201cU\u201d shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A \u201cV\u201d shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. The softer \u201cU\u201d shape ensures that the cup is a consolidation pattern with valid support at the bottom of the \u201cU\u201d. The perfect pattern would have equal highs on both sides of the cup, but this is not always the case.\n\nCup Depth: Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to 1/2. In extreme situations, the maximum retracement could be 2/3, which conforms with Dow Theory [or Crypto FUD Theory].\n\nHandle: After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. Sometimes it is prudent to wait for a break above the resistance line established by the highs of the cup.\n\nDuration: The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months (Jan-Jun), sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks.\n\nVolume: There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance.\n\nTarget: The projected advance after breakout can be estimated by measuring the distance from the right peak of the cup to the bottom of the cup.  Based on crypto FOMO, estimated range could be $650 - $1,000, barring any black swan event.  \n\n----------------------\nKey ST/LT events brewing for ETH:  \n(1) DevCon\n(2) Network Upgrades: Metropolis (Byzantium, Constantinople), Serenity, Raiden, Casper/PoS\n(3) Ethereum Network effect and continued growth (https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/07/20/these-pictures-show-how-ethereum-is-taking-over-the-digital-currency-world.html)\n(4) Real-world release of DApps expected\n(5) BTC weakness due to Segwit2x concerns\n", 8], ["2017-09-15 11:31:38", "Covered shorts around 3000-3100 usd btc\nMissed BCH below 400 as too busy trading but fomoed at 420\n\nThink btc maybe 3600 and BCH 480-500 achievable\nWould reinvest profits in coins for cold storage\nRince and repeat \n\nMany short term opportunities.

Just like some other in this sub, I have the chance to have acquired some \u201cfuck you money\u201d, crypto did contribute a little but most of my net wealth comes from my days working in the M&A team at an IB. Not that I think the previous gives me any sort of authority and/or provides me with a very special edge when it comes to investing into crypto, but I do think it helps me a lot with one thing I will developed further down in this post. I am well diversified (kind of evenly spread in-between real-estate in different jurisdictions / cash / crypto). I\u2019m bullish on the crypto asset class on the LT (so do have a vested interest in crypto) but wouldn\u2019t want to waste my energy trying to force my opinion down the throats of anyone. I come on this sub as I think it\u2019s a good source of information, I genuinely enjoy some of the conversation and, most of all, it reminds me of my days as a lurker in Ethtrader in 2016 (it seems like it was ages ago for some reasons).\n\n\nCouple of thoughts for your considerations u/etheraddict88 (not intended as a personal attack in any sort of way, form of fashion):\n\n\n1)\tI\u2019ve been reading your post since when you were the most bullish permabull of the band last year. I was also bullish at the time. I always thought your case for Ethereum was weak / poorly articulated at best. One of my key issue was your lack of nuance, either because that\u2019s how you genuinely thought at the time or because you thought your exaggerations were making your argument stronger \u2013 i.e. if you couldn\u2019t manage to fully align someone with your views, at least you thought you would bring them somewhere in the middle. I don\u2019t think the previous is a good way to make a point when engaging with highly educated and rational individuals. The other thing that I was struggling with was the fact that the efforts you deployed to articulate your reasoning quite often showed your lack of understanding of economics, finance (i.e. valuation and the like) and of the corporate world in general (I could give many examples of the previous just digging in your history but have no interest in doing so \u2013 other redditors can form their own view on this. last in date was you relaying McAfee\u2019s non-sense parallel between the cost of producing a BTC and market price for this asset. Anyone with some culture in economics knows since Adam Smith\u2019s essay on market mechanism theory that it is a simple fallacy). Not trying to debate these various points with you but know that this is how you came across to me: Extremely (i.e. too) bullish given the information available at the time with a low-quality reasoning to back it up. Today, that is still how you come across when I read you except from the fact that you now turned bearish.\n\n\n2)\tYou wrote few months ago something along the line of \u201cI\u2019m not a good trader but I have a very special way of thinking which gives me a special edge and allows me to do the right investment decision on the LT\u201d. Keep in mind that a lot of us have been making the right calls very early on just like you did. We\u2019re just not as vocal about it as you are. Beware of not falling for the survivorship bias. You and I (as well as lot of early investors in this sub) might not be so smart. Sure, having some conviction is obviously necessary in order to achieve anything in life but like a lot things it\u2019s all about striking the right balance. Over-confidence is no good (\"make sure the wish isn't the father of the thought\").  As far as I\u2019m concerned, you don\u2019t come across as humble enough (that may explain why you\u2019ve been irritating some people around here).\n\n\n3)\tRegarding whether or not we are in a bubble / we are heading toward total collapse, my answer is: Maybe. As you know, it is far from being my base case scenario. Very happy to read contrarian view point, just like when they are well-articulated and more importantly, I dislike seeing dramatic figure of speech and people trying to explain me they know for sure (no one has a crystal ball). I just find it very off-putting. So, getting back to my background, I\u2019ve been working in the M&A space for years, valuing various type of assets (initially mostly in the energy and infrastructure space \u2013 e.g. pipeline, network of toll roads, telecommunication tower networks and then moved to the sponsors team being more focused on technology firms). Previous gave me a fairly accurate view on 1) how much money is chasing assets amongst institutional investors and 2) more importantly, my view on value has been calibrated based on these major transactions have been pushing through (smallest deal I ever worked on was >1Bn$). When ETH got to $42 (i.e. 4$Bn market cap), sure I was unsettled by the growth we experienced but kept in mind that 4$bn was peanuts, close to nothing at all, in the grand scheme of things. Previous helped me to keep my LT storage in my hardware wallet and \u201cre-calibrate\u201d. Price level at which I got in ETH is irrelevant to the price it may get to on the long run. Today, we\u2019re oscillating somewhere around 25-30$bn market cap. This is still relatively small. We have significant room to grow further. There are, of course, risks involved and it may take much longer than many expect (or even potentially not happen), however being so sure that we are done and due for a massive correction just doesn\u2019t sounds right to me. I would recommend you let some place for nuances in your analysis.\n\nEDIT: formatting", 18], ["2017-09-19 15:57:29", "[deleted]", 7], ["2017-09-19 15:07:45", "Thanks for the mention mate.

Perhaps a small portion of your super in crypto and the rest in blue chip equities/properties/commodity ETFs?\n\nI'm in a somewhat similar boat in that I made some very small investments in ether back in April '16 and have been steadily investing more funded from selling off managed funds and shares. Don't get me started on using funds from my mortgage offset to invest... it is so tempting but I feel like it will rapidly spiral out of control from there!\n\nMy conundrum was finding the right balance between 'new' and 'traditional'... applying the principle of not investing more than I was willing to lose really helped with that decision.", 2], ["2017-09-13 16:30:42", "I cannot give advice, but only share how i aproach this myself.\n\nI believe in long term value investing, and crytptos are one of the most disruptive tech that we've seen in the last 10y. So the approach is to pick some coins that reflects on real projects, with real products that real people could mass adopt. Pick those projects that you believe in and hold them, monitor that they stay on top, and if they fall behind (i mean in tech or project dev, not in market cap) then you can still slowly arbitrage to best alternate to you pick coming in.\n\nAlso I believe that China will be a big part of Blockchain tech, their gvt will do anything they can to help their entrepeunuer take off in that space, so picking some China coins that are alternate projects to establish one seems a very good long term pick to me. (think like Huawei vs Apple in smartphones, would you have picked Huawei 5 years ago while they were starting in mobiles?)

I work in private equity, and in a strange way there are a lot of parallels to the private capital markets and crypto, especially relative to public markets. Public markets are far more efficient,   and we have 200 years of data and fundamental analysis, which by and large supports the valuations that we see (with a few notable exceptions, most often in tech). Private companies and crypto are totally different animals. My friend works for an infra fund and I was telling him about crypto and he pulled out some statistic that he read that based on the total amount of money in the market relative to the total number of bitcoins, BTC should be about $2000. I was baffled to think that he is viewing BTC as an asset like a stock. Stock prices are intended to represent the value of one share of a company, and we have access to all kinds of information about the company's performance to assess the likely value of a share in ownership. Part of the reason for this access is because companies have a responsibility to the shareholders. This means that, in essence, every publicly traded company is for sale, because if the shareholders get an offer that makes sense, the company will trade, even if management disagrees. \n\nThe thing is though, not every private company or every bitcoin/ether is for sale, at any price, which is why you are starting to see valuations rise higher and higher. Private equity has raised an incredible amount of capital over the last few years, much of which will go unspent, because there simply aren't enough companies for sale at a fair price. That being said, and this is the most important thing that \"sophisticated\" investors often forget when they get too caught up in charts: assets like these are worth whatever someone is willing to pay. I have worked with companies doing $10M in revenue that wanted $100M to sell their business. My job as an investor is to assess the real market potential of their products and technology, not against past performance (although that certainly plays a role) but against future potential. It's the same with crypto currency. I'm just surprised at the short sightedness of some of the worlds best investors who come out against crypto. \n\nJamie Dimon's company makes hundreds of millions  of dollars per year placing its clients' assets into private equity funds that invest with extremely high risk profiles, often using 6,7,8 times leverage, into extremely illiquid assets (private companies), many of which (unlike crypto) don't have nearly the long term growth potential to justify the price tags they are getting. And returns continue to creep downward while the risk appetite continues to increase. \n\nI bought Facebook stock at $19 the summer after its IPO. I was actually an analyst at JP Morgan at the time, and I remember my Managing Directors making fun of me saying that Facebook was poorly monetized, china doesn't want Facebook so the market is too small, etc etc. When the price started to rise even with missed earnings, they told me I was speculating, as though it were some kind of a crime. My bet was that even though Facebook was in its infancy and still figuring it out, that it would one day become a powerful for connecting people, content, and brands. And I was right. And I think I'm right again with crypto. \n\nI would say that, yes, people in crypto are speculating. But we forget that speculating is not inherently bad. The term is like a dirty word, but it's all about price discovery: what is the market willing to pay, and what does that say about the future prospects of the asset, if anything? Remember that the catalyst for Bitcoin's first meteoric rise was when Cyprus started shutting down people's bank accounts in the spring of 2013. That's when I realized that this is something really powerful. \n\nWe bought 51% of that $10M revenue company at a $100M valuation. Three years later, we are in process to sell it for $300M. Facebook stock has gone gangbusters. Crypto is still in the early days of finding it's place, but I suspect that everyone in this sub will do just fine. Speculating doesn't always end in disaster.

The impulsive, insecure and impatient will get weeded out by shorters who recognize wanes in buy support and the rest of the new money educates itself on the product and draws a new crowd in expanding the market.\n\nRegarding the chart; ok didn't pay enough attention to the link but that is exactly what he has said about ETH:FIAT repeatedly. I think after such a monumental rise a correction is due but depending on your timeframe and mindset (holder vs swing trader vs day trader) it may be a blip, a missed opportunity or a massive correction.\n\nWhatever occurs it will happen in a logarithmic channel so the adopters a cyclical generation earlier have little to worry about.\n\nI think there is a pattern of exponential growth in ETH and provided you are willing to logarithmically scale it and assume a cyclicity in the market in terms of entry rate and maturation of participants, certain cyclical trading trends will simply bear out on a increasing scales until global saturation of participants is reached. \n\nSince crypto is far more accessible than stocks (and for the ongoing duration more favourable and profitable) I think this will take longer than most people realise.\n\nThe Livermore chart I've seen used on ETH at least 5 times in the last 12 months; usually most vocally in bear trends. The correction comes; support is found in the logarithmic level of scale, the overall uptrend resumes.\n\nThere are seasonal factors to consider; tax filings, Christmas holidays and other things which mean traders who create liquidity need to take profit. In the context of continual mining sell pressure, forces can dynamically shift seasonally to favour a bear market periodically.\n\nMy comments today go into this in more detail. What I will say is don't disregard a pattern even if the reasons for it aren't obvious. I'm seeing a trend and I've hung out in this space long enough to recognise the factors before it.\n\nI'll truly worry if ETH goes sub $100 because we will have broken a logarithm of growth but as long as the next floor is higher than the previous one, its really just a setup for the next bull run if you're willing to wait.", 18], ["2017-09-14 13:17:27", "Reread it then read my follow up.

There have been rumors that IOTA and ETH talk about joint ventures. Only image what that could be. See the difference with BTC and ETH is if IOTA wants to talk to a CEO about a joint venture there is a CEO to talk to. WIth BTC there are 2 or 3 or 4 and nothing gets done.

The run-up to from $290 - $400 (June 9 - 12) was hard to justify, and the portion from \u2248$345 - $400 (June 11 - 12) even harder to justify in retrospect. At the time, however, there was forward-looking optimism concerning the Global Blockchain Summit in Chengdu on the 14th and 15th.  \n\nAfter there was no blockbuster announcement a la those in May, price dove (in approximately the same manner it did in both May and March); however, in my opinion, the throwback from the big dip was perhaps too strong, as it brought us back to the mid-point of our run-up. This would have been in line with March's similar movements. May's dip rebounded much more resiliently because there was a lag in accounts being funded on Coinbase, so we had a backlog of speculators who opened accounts during the run-up but had to wait to buy until the days following the rebound. But we don't have lines of waiting retail investors this month. Instead, we had an ICO that created a transaction backlog that forced Coinbase to lock up ETH transactions for 12 hours, which probably spooked quite a few of those same people waiting to invest last month. Add to that the negative publicity of the flashcrash, and here we are.  \n\nAll that said, a fud-inducing event like Status shouldn't happen again. Vitalik wrote that his recent ~~change~~ improvement proposal (EIP #648) can handle up to eight Status ICO's (thank you, u/HODLORofWinterfell for reporting this). Unfortunately, the flashcrash and Status ICO helped justify negative sentiment that the ICO bubble will pop from irresponsible developers selling en masse. \n\nAdditional thought: There seems to be widespread awareness of BTC's possible dip; I've seen projections ranging from 1800 - 1400. On the GDAX chart, there seems to have been support on a \"secondary neckline\" drawn from areas of support just above each  armpit of the head and shoulders pattern. If this pattern breaks, we should undoubtedly benefit, as we already have.

Due to the way BTC adjusts difficulty, a minority chain with a small fraction of the hashrate on the current ptotocol would have very low chances of survival (extremely long block times at the current difficulty until the adjustment period which may never be reached). Of course, a fork could include a difficulty adjustment change, but nothing of that sort is currently being widely considered.\n\nIn fact, it appears that segwit2x will be the way forward, which is really a band-aid solution that just kicks the problem down the road for a few months.

Once polo listed etc, problems ensued with replay attacks and splitting funds. Even those lucky enough to get both coins immediately on polo had no idea what was going to happen in price terms. The split was only possible because of the way Ethereum adjusts difficulty, which imediately dropped to accommodate the (10%ish of hashrate on the ETC chain).\n\nIf something similar to ETC happened on BTC without the minority immediately hardforking again, 10% hashrate would make block times go up to several hours, with 144 blocks required before the difficulty brought the times down. In the mean while, miners would make almost no money for there efforts while encouring the same costs for a block reward on a chain sure to be valued less than the majority BTC chain.

And when I started reading their white paper it changed real quick (like many). When I started digging deeper after that, it became red flag after red flag after red flag (and many more)... And their uncapped ICO is just a tip of that iceberg if you ask me (as many can confirm with solid facts). \n\nIf you want a breakdown on the red flags: \n/u/eeksskee made a very good recap on it, which I could not have described better myself.

Tezos is a textbook example on developers being 'GREEDY' written in capitals. And that doesn't rhyme with 'TRUST' like it should.\n\nOn a bullish note:\nWhen you think it's worth diversifying in.. Keep an eye on their crowd sale while it's running. It's uncapped, so you don't need to jump into it from the start. Wait till the end. When it reaches insane amounts near the end it's better not to jump onboard (unless you want to take the chance you will be the first to cash out). In that case wait for the moment they hit the exchange afterwards (if it does...). Their price will most likely drop like a heavy brick within days.

Here are its three prongs:  \n* Individuals invest money  \n* In a common enterprise  \n* With the expectation that they would earn a profit solely through the efforts of others.  \n\nI would *love* the chance to argue against Howey and propose a new test (if I don't get too busy working out plea deals for pump and dump scam artists).

I suspect that we'll see a fairly broad-based repricing, even if only minor, once the SEC takes someone to task over a vaporware ICO. And I don't believe our sphere is too small for them to care. Compared to what we see in even our smallest of small-cap coins, the SEC routinely prosecutes cases involving far less sums of money lost by fewer investors. Plus, many of those cases involve investments---backed by more viable products than what many ICOs possess---that are even less arguably securities than cryptos are. In short, the SEC files on people with stronger factual and legal defenses than what we might see in the first action against a token issuer.\n\nLong-term, I think that the SEC doing its job and trying to protect investors helps this space mature, and that's a good thing.

Augur talks given at Coinbase, and lots of staff support of Augur (see twitter, public talks, etc).\n* Coinbase was planning to add ERC-20 tokens in Q2, but in a blog post said they'd be pushing it back to Q4 following issues with customer service. Just before this delay, their official blog profiled tokens, and the three highlighted were REP, GNT, and ANT.\n* REP platform launches very soon. And unlike some other coins/tokens, which still need to grow ecosystems and attract developers before their utility begins to pay off, Augur has the potential to begin generating actual payoff much sooner (and lead to growing demand on Coinbase).\n* Prediction markets are, in general, a major goal of crypto in the near term (and the market is potentially massive). So it would make sense that either REP or GNO would be added eventually (and currently GNO has too large a proportion of tokens held by developers).\n* As a crypto OG, Augur has community respect and connections (and is relatively uncontroversial in the space, unlike even popular projects like XRP and XMR).\n* Lots of small unsubstantiated rumors (from CSS code, to recent \"random\" pump, to reports of REP being permanently tracked on monitors at Coinbase).\n\nStrikes against REP:\n\n* It had a crowdsale, during which investment returns were emphasized. This may be one reason by XMR may have a leg-up over most all other coins/tokens, as it never went through an ICO.\n* While prediction markets are not illegal in general, many types of prediction markets are (political and sports betting in the US).

First and foremost, there was a glaring lack of references - in the video or project's website. Likewise I saw no means of inspecting the code via Github, or scrutinising the technology being touted. The generic branding (which bares far too much resemblance to Bitconnect) and poor production values (eg, you cannot make out the device which the presenter displays in the video, which I suspect is intentional) further adds a sense of inauthenticity.\n\nThe presenter also appears rather elusive. My attempts to verify his resume on Linked In et al came up short. Likewise, when asked what he considered were the project's biggest obstacles and chief competitors, he suggested I DM him my questions instead (which I did in the ensuing Telegram chat, eliciting no response).\n\nThere are plenty of promises regarding the tokens you will get for completing each task - most notably for sitting through the whole webinar - but none are forthcoming. Instead you are informed you are one step closer to receiving them after fulfilling each requirement.\n\nWe have already lived through the era of ICOs without substance.

Of course you could say, if you want to live on you UBI you must move outside big cities where price of rent are lower, you can ask someone or a family to move 20-30km away but not to move from Switzerland to Thailand for example just because the given UBI can only pay the rent for a small flat in Thailand.

And in the absence of any documentation that explained this in more detail I remain skeptical. But my doubts may be misplaced.\n\nI also acknowledge your point that these registered airdrops are a bit of a hit and miss affair - as you would expect when something is being offered for free. At the same time I have noticed an increasing trend away from more substantial offerings like Accelerator Network's (ACC) and Xenon's (XNN) registered airdrops, which I don't recall taking up an inordinate amount of effort or time; towards a model where tens of thousands of users (or should I say \"accounts\") on Telegram are incentivised to flood social media with often vacuous marketing material in a manner far too similar to the pump schemes being co-ordinated in the same medium.\n\nHowever, like most things in crypto, the market typically self-corrects. In this way, I am hoping the present downturn will clear much of the present clutter way, making it easier to identify more valuable opportunities like Polymath. I'm not for a second suggesting we should go down Facebook's path where the user becomes the product. I do however find active airdrops possess the potential to build powerful network effects.

Joseph states that each user can easily see when he is being scammed, but that means every participant in the network is expected to run his own systems to constantly validate all activity on all side-chains he is participating in.\n\nThe entire value of Bitcoin and derivatives is that I can trust on third parties to operate the system correctly, because they are economically incentivised to do so. I see no such mechanism in OMG. The suggested approach is to pay some third party 'a little fee' to validate all the transactions, but nothing is stopping a malicious side-chain operator from stealing all the money on the side-chain and simply bribing the validator(s) with a larger sum than the users are willing to pay. The only way to economically safeguard against this is if the users on the chain are willing to pay the validator a larger sum than the total value represented on that side-chain, which is obviously not viable.\n\nIn the end the entire system comes down to 'check if everything is done correctly yourself, or trust in some third party (that has no economic motivation to be truthful) to not screw you over'.\n\nDisclosure: I have no positions in OMG", 5], ["2017-09-08 21:51:55", "I am as skeptical of this as I am of the Lightning Network.\n\nHopefully I'm proven wrong.", 2], ["2017-09-08 09:46:01", "For the uninitiated, Joseph Poon is the founder of the btc lightning network and is currently a member of the Omisego team, not Golem.\n\n\nThe video is worth the watch for sure.

I'm feeling a little bit bearish, and I can't quite put my finger on why, it is more of a feeling from trading bitcoin a long time when mining profitability is this high. At the current inflation rate and prices we are getting about $7 million dollars a day in fresh coins, and in times of lull I always feel like that will have downward pressure on the price. Historically after a big rise in crypto where mining is profitable, things get bearish if new buyers aren't entering the market like crazy. When you consider how many ETH there are and how much of that is illiquid, $50 million dollars of inflation a week is a lot for the bulls to handle, if we hit $400-500 in the short term, the problem gets worse. Honestly, if we can just go sideways and hold this price point as the mining difficulty climbs, that will be impressive to me.\n\nIt is a funny phenomenon, but something that I've noticed in bitcoin land, is that a few months after people start shutting off their miners saying \"f-- this, it costs so much more to mine than it does to just buy the currency\", and like magic, the next bull-run starts.\n\nObviously this mid-term view probably shouldn't play a large role in our next movement, but when the price is significantly higher than it was a short time ago, miners will just keep trying to frontload paying off their mining rigs, because a lot of them have this sort of \"Well, once i sell like 6 coins, my rig will be paid off, then I can hodl\".\n\nI did the same thing with bitcoin, then again with litecoin, and although I don't live in a place condusive to mining ETH, and I'm a little older without the pressure of feeling like I need to pay myself back a bit for purchases in the $1500 range (I can thank Magic cards for that, they have desensitized me to expensive hobbies) I imagine others are doing the same.\n\nAnd even the sentiment in the ethtrader sub isn't FOMOing. So where is the FOMO? Can a Bull explain to me why we should retest new highs?

That tells me they are nowhere near rolling anything out and we'd be lucky to get Raiden by late 2018 (most ICOs take more than a year for a product).\n\nAnd why does there need to be a token for it? Raiden is supposed to be about making ETH scale, i.e., improving the damn coin that we all already own, not finding new ways to milk the money cow of the crypto markets. \n\nAdditionally, I think Vitalik himself was against it, and may have just called it a \"baked-in scheme for profit.\" At the same time as the Raiden ICO announcement he just tweeted that he will be contributing his OMG money to helping ethereum scale. https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/911217401848487936\nKid has a lot of class but I'm suddenly less sure about the other developers.", 22], ["2017-09-20 02:46:59", "Current feelings: I felt the need to contribute because I have been a hardcore lurker for a while now so hopefully someone gets something from this.\n\n\nDue to china I sold 50-60 percent of my stack starting from around 370 down to 300\u2026 I felt the need to reduce risk.

This was the smart play back then but markets change and now I am wary of the fact that the upcoming metropolis fork, which has been hyped to death on r/ethtrader, may be price in, leading to a short pump then a \u201csell the news\u201d event.

They'll be unable to pay the maintenance and utility fees that come along with mining. Even if there is no ban, a lack of profitability will see a lot of miners either relocate, or give up entirely. Sure they can use VPNs and sell on other exchanges but then they risk government prosecution. A lot of people on other subs are saying that China being out of crypto is already priced in, which I find very hard to believe. There's no way you can price in a huge loss to mining pools, we won't know until it happens. On top of all this, high level Chinese crypto holders are almost definitely still looking to offload and dump their currencies on other exchanges, which will keep the price from moving upwards.

Devs don't work for free and a Raiden ICO brings more capital and more opportunities for investment from the traditional markets. They also have the best dev resources in the industry. I would expect to see EEA members in on this (i.e. MasterCard, etc), which means that ETH becomes a much stronger platform in the long run as not just a smart contracts platform and robust ecosystem that it is today, but the value increases exponentially with a payment platform to be a legitimate contender to BTC/others with true scalability. \n\nWithout ETH and ICOs, it would be a very boring market and for anyone that has enjoyed the ride so far in the last 24 months, the opportunities in the next 24 months are going to be a wild ride. China is in the rear view mirror for now, the hype cycle has calmed down a bit, we're getting to the point of seller exhaustion, Jamie Dimon/institutional pundits are just playing the market like everyone else (JP Morgan is part of the EEA, so it's safe to say they're on the right team) and there are a lot of projects that we will begin to see take real world effect in the coming months. \n\nMy guess is that we'll see some continued consolidation, but with all the traders and institutional capital sitting on the sidelines, who's left to sell other than the bots? The last time there was increased FUD levels and traders sat on 100% fiat was mid-July. Everyone thinks that they're TA is showing the market going down to July levels, and even some of the seasoned traders here we're talking about double digit ETH and $1000 BTC back on July 16.  Guess what: it never happened. The market bounced and we went from $65mm to $177mm market cap and bottomed out at $103mm. \n\nThe level of FUD in the last three weeks has hit ATHs, surpassing the combined levels of July, March, and January. Go to any forum/twitter feed now and everyone can show a fancy chart for why we're going to see sub 200/3000 ETH/BTC and we're going to go into a major bear market like 2014-2015.  \n\nHere's some TA and stats for all the bears: \n\n(1) August 15, the 1-day MACD was the lowest we've seen ever based on the highest sell volumes we've seen ever and RSI was the lowest we've seen since the aftermath of the BFX hack. \n\n(2) The bear market volume of 2014-15 was in the 10s of millions USD with spikes in the hundreds. We're now safely in the billions per day with spikes in the 10s of billions. \n\n(3) We've gone from scammy ICOs, hacks, black market BTC, and only a few shady exchanges to predominately and legitimately funded, licensed organizations with robust teams and functional platforms. ICO offerings today look like IPOs, but funded through the blockchain. Regulation has been very positive and participatory, while consistently providing thoughtful dialogue at every major blockchain conference. Exchanges are more robust and liquid than ever before with more capital waiting for the right time to get in (You can even get a crypto IRA). The professionals are creating legitimacy that will begin to strengthen the market for the billions of dollars that want in early. Eventually it'll become trillions that flow in from your Fidelity or other stock accounts. \n\n(4) The speculative projects that we've all helped to fund through ICO investments all have vast teams working furiously to get them released to the public and that will begin the next wave of growth in the market very soon as we've heard from key thought leaders like Roger Ver, Vitalik, Andrew Keyes, Joe Lubin, the Tapscotts, the Drapers, etc. \n\n(5) There are 17mm BTC (and BCH) wallets, 8mm ETH wallets and 17.5 billion people in the world. Add just those up and that's only 0.5% of the world population, not accounting for multiple wallets per person. The growth of wallets and transactions is exponential because the industry is still so small, so the bear case for anything longer than 30 days just doesn't add up. \n\nPrediction: By the end of 2018...(1) We'll have one Bitcoin winner and we'll be trading in \"Satoshis\", not Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash/Bitwit/Bitcore/etc.(edit: the other coins will exist, but only one will become the front runner as chosen by the market) (2) The market will reach $1 trillion in market cap and run on a decentralized exchange system across the globe (3) The market will consist of 1000s of coins that touch every industry (4) Cryptocurrencies will be used to pay for anything across the world (5) Multiple governments will cryptonize fiat currency. \n\nJust my few cryptocents.

I'm a bagholder now I guess\n- Invested in ETH at 315 hoping for a Friday rebound, but think it's a slow grind downward and it looks like a bad trade.\n\n***\n\nOverall thoughts: I was bearish Bitcoin at the start of the week, and thought it would trade down to 3500, seeing the liquidity stress represented by the inter-exchange arb, and thought the ICO news from China and Korea would be very bearish for smart-contract cryptos, so I sold most of my ETH and QTUM out and went short BTC. I was caught off guard by the strong NEO rebound midweek, but managed to catch the tactical QTUM trade. 6 months out I see at least QTUM:NEO parity, and hold a large QTUM position. \n\nHowever, I noticed the market seems resilient to the China and Korea news, and on further reflection since only China is delisting exchanges, I see only a partial outflow of Chinese money into crypto. Yuan share of Bitcoin trading seems to have been about 10-25% of global Bitcoin trade, and the Chinese exchanges'margin allowances for traders haven't struck me as insane, so I see only a modest price drop. \n\nAdditionally, the citizens in modern China worship money. As long as crypto is in an uptrend, they'll find ways around this ban. So I'm not bearish on Bitcoin either below 3,500 or by end September, and would consider adding a large position at $3,000 and/or at end September. \n\nThe hardest hit should be (and indeed were) NEO and QTUM, but QTUM is working on novel tech for intercompatibility between BTC and ETH blockchains and has a plausible pivot. NEO on the other hand just seems like cult worship of Da Hongfei and the thesis is basically \"China hurr hurr hurr\". There is a Chinese saying - (\u67aa\u6253\u51fa\u5934\u9e1f) - \"the first bird in formation gets shot\". China is a mafia state. You pay your dues to the government, and those with government links don't flaunt it. When NEO heavily advertised their government connections, I became convinced they didn't have any.\n\nETH is rightfully in a downtrend, as there is a temporary mismatch between expectations and reality - Vitalik sold people on a world computer, and right now it looks like a very slow and unreliable Windows 3.1.\n\nI'm adding to WAVES and QTUM here, as their valuations strike me as undervalued. OMG seems insanely overvalued and I have reduced positions there.\n\nMy macro-thesis is that this is a gigantic valuation bubble which will pop like 1929, but several national champions which can entrench themselves in the popular imagination like WAVES for Russia and QTUM for Asia can thrive in the aftermath with state support. Trans-national blockchains are utopian and will go through the largest hype cycle before the reality of state intervention via capital controls and exchange delisting comes through. I put ETH and (maybe) OMG in this category, however there is a long way to go before disillusionment will set in (as long as they solve the network issues). Bitcoin Segwit1x will be usurped by either Bitcoin cash or Bitcoin Segwit2x, but in the long run they will all be replaced by privacy coins. XMR looks like the current front-runner there.\n\nIn any case, 1929 wasn't the insane crash that people fear. Over two days, the stock market fell 25%, which feels tame by crypto standards. There WILL be time to get out, but the key thing there is to resist greed and the inevitable delusional calls to HODL. Tight stop losses and discipline will be the key.

What a shitty weekend. The thing is a most long time  hodlrs/traders know that the long weekends tend to be bearish more than bullish. Especially after a longer rally like we had.\n\n Regarding the crack down on ICOs in China I am going to say it is actually a good thing. I know I am just trying to spin it positive however listen to me. The one evil that can ruin a good thing like crypto is too many scammers and theifs ruining it for the new people entering. I really doubt that China will block everything. China just wants to have ICOs verified that there is a real team that is working toward a common goal. There is no way that China will let the East raise all the money for the new technology. China just has to have it under control as always. We have google and we have biadu. We will have 2 blockchains for smart contracts that I am pretty sure of. ETH has the advantage at this point. Hhowever China will do everything it can to help the Chinese chain just like they always do. \n\nWith all that said this is a margin deleveraging correction in my opinion. Over the last 4 months a ton of new speculators that have no idea what they are doing entered. Crypto was once a bad word on facebook.  In the last few months it has exploded on there and everyone thinks they own the next 10x coin. Usually when that happens the next 10x investment is the obvious yet noobies look elsewhere. The obvious is eth and btc. I would stress to keep most of your stack in the top 5 or 10 coins. Pick your few favorite projects and be a hodlr. Take a flyer but dont go more than you an really afford to lose. Finally I will admit I thought we would hold in the $350.00 on eth so I am surprised to see us at the $280.00. I just have to focus on the bright future we have in crypto. No place in the world is there this much brain power working this hard on a new project period.

Weak and levered BTC shorts have been stopped out already. \n\nGiven the overbought nature and bullishness of the market a natural resolution would be a long squeeze at some stage and a very violent 40%-50% flash crash or selloff in BTC which would be very short lived for a month only for example, just to clean up the market and reset indicators before a continuation of the rally till 2018-2019????  \n\nThe coming BTC hardfork and ETH renewed bullishness could quickly change the technical picture on BTC especially shorts have been cleaned\n\nBe careful with leverage guys", 10], ["2017-09-04 16:27:28", "Wow", 10], ["2017-09-03 13:17:00", "TL;DR:  Growth is far from over; Conserve capital when the market goes parabolic and BTFDs;  Hodling the top tokens with the best tech/utility/payment will work out long term (i.e. the Amazons, Microsofts, Apples, Googles of blockchain);  Focus short term capital on the best alpha;  Become a student of all things crypto and take FUD/Hype with a grain of salt to form your own opinions for the future of this space.\n\n----------------\n\nOpEd:\n\nI would have to disagree that \"a rally\" (aka continued growth) is gone nor do I have any sense that a bubble has formed and is about to burst.  \n\nThis is a very new market that today only consists of technology VC funding via ICOs, investors, exchanges, market makers and traders.  What we see is a growing audience, market, and new capital that is also gaining the attention of money sharks and regulators looking to draw blood in the water.  There's no doubt that big money will continue to manipulate markets, which will make it harder for long-term holders, but a balanced perspective is required for both short term trading and portfolio management (aka hodling).  \n\nUsing history as an example, holding Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc through all the ups and downs still would have made any modest portfolio seem very fortunate today.  Letting go of the dogs like Yahoo, AOL and others is just part of becoming an investor that is always staying engaged.  \n\nSame holds true for crypto.  Buy and hold for over a year and it's proven to be better than equities for the crypto big caps (which are still very young).\n\nA few things we look at for short and long term investment as a crypto hedge fund:\n\n1.  There are numerous startup funds ramping up to bring institutional capital into the market with estimates in the $2-3 Billion range over the next 6-12 months.  The [mostly manipulated] dips we will see will get softer over time as the market cap grows, decentralized exchanges begin creating a global, connected marketplace and more holders are born, which makes it more difficult to control.  No different than the dotcom era.  The goal is to focus on the ones that have a proven track record, best teams/advisors, and real world applications and implications.  \n\n2.  We are still in the early innings.  We have seen this market develop from the bottom up, allowing every day folks get an opportunity to become part of this market.  It's high risk, but it doesn't take long for people to realize that it's not child's play.  However, maturity will come from community education, intuitive tools and a degree of wing-clipping along the way.  It's safe to say that the wild west of crypto has the possibility to turn into the most free market system the world has ever seen.\n\n3.  It's hard to see the long term in this space because things are moving so quickly, but it's a very important piece of the puzzle.  This market is maturing at a very fast pace and it will become much more professional and organized each coming month, quarter and year with new technology that is developed, new standards that level the playing field, and a growing audience.\n\n4.  From a utility/scarcity standpoint, the large caps that have network utility and payment capability (BTC/BCH, ETH, Dash, XMR, etc) have not even scratched the global surface of everyday usage as currency.  Bitcoin only has ~16.5mm wallets, which is 0.002% of the world population.  \n\n5.  Meanwhile, dapps and exchanges being built [on Ethereum] and cross-chain implementations mean that the market will become less centralized over time and grow in such a way that will alleviate certain negative network effects that will lead to decoupling from BTC.  \n\n----------\nConsidering this is a sub for trading, all of these are very big picture, long-term perspectives that have little impact on short-term market moves.  However, we will soon see markets evolve in ways that we cannot even imagine, which means we'll see a tremendous amount of volatility;  for traders, volatility is the lifeblood of creating alpha.

Charts across all majors went into short-term oversold territory, with 3-hr divergence hitting the lowest since June 27.  All charts for majors showed that we were in overbought territory leading into BTC's rise to $5k, so kudos to /u/GrossBit for calling the pre-PBOC correction.  Longer term charts show that we may not be through the woods yet and could very well see some choppy waters in the near term.\n\nThe news from China (and South Korea) on ICOs was swift and created some good buying opportunities for anyone that was watching the blood bath start to slow.  Looking at the price action across the fiat onramps (Coinbase/GDAX, Kraken, Gemini), there continues to be a steady $150-200 USD gap on BTC and $10-15 for ETH compared to offshore exchanges like OKCoin, BTCC, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, etc.  It appears that new fiat is investing/reinvesting on this latest correction, which is in line with my earlier comment about continued growth with an estimated $2-3 Billion looking to enter the market through the new crypto investment funds.   The dips will be bought, but smart buyers are not planning to run up the market as we've seen before and the recoveries seem to be more muted than we saw earlier this year through June/July.\n\nAt this point, the market has shown a healthy bounce from yesterday's lows.  However, much of the action has cooled and we should expect to see sideways action in the near term as traders digest the news.  \n\nAs it relates to Bitfinex, it appears the PBOC announcement does not have a direct impact as BFX is HQ'd in Hong Kong and falls under HK SFC jurisdiction, which issued guidance on exchanges and ICOs specific to securities (their definition is similar to the US-based Howey test) (see http://www.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=17PR117).  According to a friend at another HK-based exchange, they also are not affected by the PBOC ICO measures (scare-tactics) and are in line with the SFC guidance, which is a good sign that BFX should be in safer territory than those in Mainland China.\n\nIf history is any judge, we should expect to see a slow steady creep upward with lower volumes and a limited news cycle in the coming weeks until Segwit 2x, Raiden/Metropolis and DevCon begin to take shape.  It'll be hard to tell what the impact will be, but it should provide for buying opportunities along the way.  \n\nAll in all, this is the life we've chosen and as it's been said before, listen closely to the mods that have been through numerous cycles like we're seeing play out.

For those who don't, I am an early investor (~USD5) of Antshares and a Singaporean Chinese based out of Singapore.\n> It has come to my attention that there is mass hysterics going on around NEO and Chinese coins due to the recent articles surfacing and re-posted without much consideration. While I understand there is a language gap and information handicap for our western investors, it seems that the panic has reached a boiling point (where I need to explain countless times about the regulations). This so-called regulations' effects are actually not noticeable at all in the Wechat cryptocurrency groups I am in.\n> Let's break down all these articles, shall we?\n> The Sauce of it all http://finance.caixin.com/2017-09-04/101140069.html The thinktank of this article is NIFA (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u91d1\u878d\u534f\u4f1a\uff08NATIONAL INTERNET FINANCE ASSOCIATION OF CHINA\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u7f29\u5199NIFA) that handles the studies of Internet financials which recommends considerations to the Central Government to ensure the financial stability of her citizens. In this article, they released an article 99 published this year which proclaims ICOs to be illegal money laundering, illegal funding and amongst other things, cheating. While we know of a lot scam ICOs, where is the article 99 they published?\n> A quick look at Chinese Government site which releases these articles, there's no Article 99.\n> See exhibit: https://imgur.com/a/q716T\n> Basically, this article has spread through different mediums and caused considerable damage to the community at large.\n> Now let us go to something more credible and released not more than 2 hours ago. The People's Bank Of China (basically financial Big Brother) has just released a statement on cryptocurrency as a whole in China. Sauce: http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/3374222/index.html\n> The main points are: 1. Token sales are not recognized by the PBC as an official channel of fund raising. As such, all cryptocurrency trading related activities are deemed as illegal until further notice.\n> Upon this report, all persons or cooperations are to stop all activities involving token sales. Any token sales that are completed prior or ongoing to this report, the team is to make arrangements to return all amounts to the investors. Any offenders will be reprimanded by relevant department of the government.\n> Upon this report, ALL cryptocurrency trading/ICO funding sites within China are to stop their operations till further notice. The relevant department of the government will stop ISPs from serving traffic to such sites should these remain operational despite this notice.\n> All financial and non-banking companies are not to start ICO fund raising campaigns.\n> Chinese investors are reminded to exercise caution when trading with cryptocurrency.\n> All financial related companies are to understand the government strategy.\n> Now, as what this report has said - All Cryptocurrency-related operations within China are to be stopped. If you have been paying attention to Chinese cryptocurrency space or Chinese ICOs, they already have heard of such news way before. That is why it is more operationally economical to stop their ICOs now than go through it and get slammed with this.\n> What is not said in the article is by when. So there is a certain grace period for these CC firms in China to wind down their operations.\n> IMHO, 1. The Central Government is stepping in to establish rules and regulations surrounding ICOs and cryptocurrency trading. 2. Cryptocurrency trading companies in China will be moving their operations overseas instead. 3. Coins originating from China will be looking to get their coins listed on international exchanges.\n> So there you have it.

However, there is a twist ahead of the S2xHF:  Byzantine and DevCon.  Byzantine is somewhat a muted expectation for successful implementation that is currently priced in, but it should demonstrate continued improvement to ETH.  DevCon on the other hand will have equally as much (and possibly more) impact on the market hype effects than Consensus had in May this year.  \n\nAs the King pumps, the Queen holds steady while the rest of the board ebbs and flows based on the play of the day.  What's really interesting is to take a step back to think about how far the industry has come in the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, or even 24 months.  \n\n(24) months ago, ETH was released to the market (FOMO)\n(18) months ago, we had the beginning of the DAO hype and plenty of ICOs of all shapes and sizes (more FOMO)\n(12) months ago, we were recovering from the DAO fork and BFX hack (FUD)\n(9) months ago, BTC broke $1,000 USD...and then the China tail whipped around (more FUD)\n(6) months ago, we were all amazed to watch BTC pull above the ATH and ETH pass $50 (FOMO)\n(4) months ago, the market just blew everyone out of the water with mind-boggling ICOs and hyped coins with no product (more FOMO)\n(3) months ago, regulation and corrections hit hard (FUD)\n(2) months ago, the market heated up after the S2x/BCH events with gains across the entire sector where new coins entered the Top 20 and pushed the sector to new highs (along with the help of talking heads like CNBC's Brian Kelly) (FOMO)\n(1) month ago, like clockwork, the China-Dimon-S2X-etc. effect enhanced a much-needed correction.\n\n-----------\n\nWhere we go from here is anyone's guess, but let's follow the trend of BTC for the moment.  The good news is that the 3+ year infighting with BTC scaling may very well be in the rearview mirror by year end after the BCH-BTG-S2x HFs, realizing that money will flow to the path of least resistance and highest profitability while ETH builds off the strength of DevCon.  IF the BTC scenario turns ugly, ETH will still have a chance to move ahead because it's clear that the ETH community has remained relatively strong in a very young experiment and came closer to market cap parity after Consensus.  Additionally, ETH has the strongest public-private partnerships of any blockchain ecosystem with an open-source, building-block approach to scaling solutions that taps just about every industry worldwide.\n\nLet's realize that every day that the industry gains global exposure is a positive sign that we're entering a new (and perhaps the 4th) inning for this \"bubble\" of a market.  Yes, it's the beginning of a bubble, but that doesn't mean that it at the end nor does it mean that it will burst anytime soon or really ever.  Yes, the Dot-Com bubble \"burst\" in 2000, but it also created an internet revolution.  We're a ways off from the Dotcom Effect, but there will be winners that will survive and thrive regardless of if or when that time comes. \n\n----------\n\nPrice Targets by YE 2017.  That's an interesting question that many have asked.  BTC $5,000 and ETH $400 would've been laughed at 6-9-12-18-24 months ago, but we all watched the market do the unimaginable.  The difference? Exposure and continued strength in security, opportunity, and global acceptance.  \n\nThis year we've seen BTC hit $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,500 and $5,000.  Pending a (big IF) non-event, the next target could be much higher than any of us expect.  The ability to move on from controversy carries a lot of weight and a lot of strength.  Out of BTCx-BTCc-BTG-BCH, the market will decide the winner(s) and be able to move forward with the best solutions for the best BTC-related platform.  It's reminiscent of a free-market version of the monopoly Antitrust Act.  If you want a scaling solution, choose BTC/S2x or BCH.  If you want store of value, choose BTG or BTC Classic.  Yes, the S2x will become BTC because there's just too much money behind it (whether we like it or not) and most likely BTG will most likely become the store of value while the hobbyists play around in a development sandbox that may or may not make it long term.  The great thing is that there will be four different coins to mine, new opportunities for development, and more room for mining options.  An $80bln market cap will add two additional opportunities for whatever the market wants for scaling, lower fees, store of value, etc.  It may get ugly for a ST period, but it should be the final bridge over the long impasse we've seen take place for so long. \n\n----------\n\nWinners and Losers.  Protocols and real-world results will become the status-quo, which we've already seen from the latest record-setting ICOs and continued regulatory guidelines/warnings.  The best of the current coins (aside from the K&Q) will be the ones that solve a long-term, global problem and enhance the blockchain ecosystem.  Decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, payment platforms, cross-chain communication, trading platforms, identity, security, storage, computing power, gaming, data/prediction analytics, voting, finance, etc.  -- these are the areas that will pave the way for current and future players that can build new roads into uncharted territory.  It all comes down to the favored few that have the right teams, advisors, partners, business models, and...capital.  All the projects that were really cool will probably remain as neat little trinkets that will most likely have a difficult time in the upcoming environment of mainstream professional sophistication that is required to succeed in an increasingly competitive landscape.  The projects that focus on anonymity and dark-web solutions will only remain viable with strong community support for a truly decentralized world of value, but it's too soon to tell the real winner and losers without a real market shakeout. \n\n----------\n\nThe world of trading.  Short term trading has basically been a game played by all of us \"small time\" enthusiasts, but we haven't seen anything yet.  If anyone thought we've seen crazy volatility, the big players are just beginning to lace up their shoes to step onto the court for a game of Blockchain.  The institutional teams are beginning to arm-up for the opportunity to bring their playbooks to this market with ETFs, options, derivatives, national dCurrencies, and a swath of other tricks of the trade to build another stream of profit centers around an entirely new industry that started with a whitepaper, but leads back to the days of good ol' Milton Friedman's declaration in 1999 that a form of digital cash will become the tool to tame the governments around the world.  \n\nIt took 9 years to begin and another 9 years to begin mainstream adoption.  The next 9 years is going to be quite a ride, but if we play our cards right, we'll be able to make some money and perhaps even build the next evolution of decentralized businesses.  ", 63], ["2017-10-13 21:13:13", "The New Heights of Crypto.\n\nAmazing.  Just plain amazing.  Anyone that called this would've been seen as crazy by all the bears from the last several weeks.  Frankly, we've been around a 2 or 3 on the FUD-FOMO scale (1-10), so this should have been expected at some point, but not at this point.  Shorts got crushed with margin covers and calls popping off all over the place on BTC and the pair.  \n\nThe last BTC run to $5,000 was met with force and fury from across the entire globe:  China, Dimon, ICOs, regulation, S2x concerns, tulip mania, etc.  One thing for sure is that Wall Street and the world was watching BTC drop to $3,000 and then float around while most of us felt trapped in TA and HF analysis paralysis.\n\nBreaking $5,000 is very significant for all of crypto as we all know that BTC strength leads to an eventual trickle-down effect into the rest of the ecosystem.\n\n--------\n\nA Successful BTC Decision.\n\nNot exactly sure what \"success\" will look like other than clarity and assurance in the decision for choosing the \"real\" BTC.  Most of the traditional institutional market really doesn't care about BTC scaling today, but if the contentious HF creates any uncertainty, the world of crypto will come crashing down for awhile until there's ultimate clarity.  \n\nHowever, as mentioned previously, we will most likely expect that the S2x backers will choose the direction of BTC.  To date, 85% of miners are still signaling for S2x and almost all NYA signers are still in tact.  Even though there is silence in the ranks, we know that they're all in major discussions behind closed doors and we'll learn very soon the direction they want to take.  Either way, the NYA/S2x group will be the critical factor that will lead the market.    \n\n--------\n\nEntering a New Era.\n\nWe are now entering a new level of FOMO, one that we haven't experienced yet.  When BTC (and crypto) was face to face with the Chimon Bearclaw, the world has been watching as it got swatted down and has now come back with a vengeance.  The headlines all over CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ, IBD, etc. will all be talking about this very soon, if not today.  The amount of [legitimate] FUD was enough to tank any stock, but not BTC, which will be an eye-opener for billions still on the sidelines.\n\nThe trend we may see repeated will be much akin to the first 6 months of 2017.  The global capital has been watching very closely, slowly dipping into the market, but it seems we are very close to the floodgates opening with only one very real hurdle remaining:  BTC, in whatever forked version, must successfully pass its final test and move beyond November with strength in order to achieve global, mainstream adoption.  \n\n--------\n\nClarity will Bring Prosperity.\n\nThe best estimate is that we will get clarity and BTC will survive yet another major trial of its lifetime.  Once this happens, we will enter the top of the next inning that will be something quite amazing.  \n\nWith clarity will come prosperity and here are some 3-6 month estimated targets to consider based on the 2017 FOMO cycles that were built on BTC strength:\nBTC:  $10,000\nETH: $750 - 1,000\nLTC:  $100 - $150\nOMG: $25 - 40\nQTUM: $40-50\nXMR:  $150 - 200\nDASH:  $750 - 1,000\nZEC:  $1,000 - $1,500\n\n--------\n\nBrace for Impact.\n\nAs we prepare to enter the next inning, it's really easy to FOMO in, raise risk thresholds, and start to gamble on the big moves.  However, take these waves with extreme caution until we get clarity.  There will be a lot of opportunity to make money and all the professional traders will be making hay, but it's important to remind everyone to be cautious, protect capital and remember that each period of FUD and FOMO will ALWAYS redirect, so don't get caught over-leveraged when that time comes.  The looming HF still has legs and it's critically important to approach these markets with extreme caution.

And since that time there have been many successful test *and* use cases with banks - for specific clients - all over the world (As far as my knowledge reaches: since mid 2014 till today). These have until now, mainly, been found behind closed doors.\n\nTheir approach and outcome (for the financial being) is currently far more advanced and valuable (and more often proven) to banks than all the *100% decentralized* solutions out there (which are still under development, not?). Which makes it a much more realistic certainty for banks to deploy it in their daily operations.\n\nThe only threshold that really needs to be taken, is that banks actually *start* using it in the daily life of their services. And I suspect that the first steps in that implementation will see the light of day soon. \n\nThe reason I suspect that is: \nBanks have already implemented it in the background (for multiple test and use cases).

And personally: I do not see any other projects that are already so advanced - In the current progress on this goal - in this respect.\n\nSo, is it undervalued? \nThat all depends on how you look at it. \n\n- When you are *only* looking at it as a currency to trade on: It's probably still overvalued.\n\n- When you see the underlying concept *and* their virtual lead: I think it is undervalued.

ETH/BTC ratio while dropping:\nim seeing -as outlined a hundred times already- that btc is the biggest problem for the eth price atm. I\u00b4m not thinking that because of the higher trade volume btc follows eth. It\u00b4s rather the overall fear what happens with bitcoin and the overall sentiment to \"sit it out in fiat\" cause everyone still sees that eth/btc is not decoupled already. In my opinion eth drops harder than btc because there is more \"smart money\" in the market (ppl who sold near the top) and new (and thats important) lets say \"FUD money\" rather than \"dumb money\". Those are the once who came in here for the quick money and arent used to such drops.\n\n2. ETH/BTC next weeks:\nwhile we\u00b4re coming closer to the event horizon people will get rly nervous because they know everyone wants to join the bullparty when the bottom was found. Once ppl see there is no more sell pressure and shorts are getting closed FOMO will take action and imo thats the point where we decouple from btc. There is so much fiat sitting on the sidelines to get back in and since the uncertain about btc will still be there ether has the opportunity to get a huge pump which btc isnt able to follow. \n\n3. sustainable?\nhere comes the problem in my thinking. I cant see such a pump as sustainable. Crypto is pure fud and fomo price finding. when it comes closer to a possible flippening ppl will get irrational as the run up to 420. \nIn my opinion the potential of ethereum is enormous. But there are some hurdles on our way. I\u00b4m seeing another hype when Metropolis takes action in the next couple of month and am concerned that ether will be highly overpriced by then (for its current development status) because noone wants to miss \"the next big thing\".\n\n\nSo here we are waiting for things take action. Noone can predict the future but i think once the next run up starts and a possible flippening is on the horizon we might get through in our 2nd or 3rd attempt (seeing the last one as 1st failed one)\n\nThanks for all your answers and the patience while reading!

One thing is for certain: blockchain is beginning to turn into something quite exciting and growing at astronomical rates around the world.  However, with growth comes a lot of FUD and it's a very necessary element if we want to see this baby grow up to be a healthy, mature industry.\n\n--------\n\nTrading the short term.  \n\nIf you listen to the seasoned traders, they're all [generally] on the sidelines as the story of the K&Q unfolds.  The King is forking for Gold and the pump isn't over, but the King's real strength or hidden weakness(es) will soon be revealed as it heads into the strongest headwind of its lifetime known as S2x.  It's a bit of a mixed bag as the NYA signers remain in continued support, albeit silent as the looming Golden Fork lies just days away.  Most likely they, and the rest of us, are accumulating BTC to get some \"free\" Gold and we'll see how the King's strength holds up after the first battle of the Forks ends up in the grander scheme.\n\nAs it sits now, the Golden Fork has been draining all the capital out of ALTs for the time being whilst ETH continues to hold at a level above relatively strong/local support of $285 heading into DC3 after the Byzantine HF pump and dump.  While we all believe the Queen has potential to become the strongest player on the board with more opportunities than the King, she still needs to prove her value amongst the players of the game.  \n\nIn all reality, the market is long BTC through the Gold Rush, softly hodling ETH, and mostly short everything else with a few exceptions for intraday trading.  For now, traders are just riding the wave of the day that can fill the short term thrill, which seems to ebb and flow behind the wake of the King - good luck for anyone trying to arbitrarily guess that game of catching knives in either direction.\n\n--------\n\nThe Brutal Facts of ETH.\n\nFor those of us that have been in the game long enough to see this market grow from just a faint dream to an astounding reality realize that this market is becoming more complex by the day.  As 2017 began, we were all hoping that ETH would be recognized for what it can become:  a platform for blockchain.  Here we are.  ETH has become a platform for a multi billion dollar application industry that created an organism for exponential development growth that will...eventually...lead to exponential value.  ETH has proven it's initial worth (in a relative range) to the market while growing with strong support from all levels of institutions, governments, and on the backs of those of us free market idealists that want to believe in a decentralized everything [fill in the blank].\n\nIn all reality, the market is just beginning to crawl after years of staring up at the ceiling from the crib.  The ecosystem got a lot of fluffy, expensive stuffed animals (dApps) thrown at it from all the endearing enthusiasts that wanted to make sure it grows up with a lot of love and encouragement, but as it grows up, the expectations are higher and it requires a lot more strength and structure to grow beyond the cute little onesies it once knew.  Out of all those fluffy stuffed animals that came along, only the strongest will survive to get through the early days of thunderstorms and that big, scary world outside.\n\nWe're in a much different world now.  The winds are getting stronger and we're not in Kansas anymore.  There are real consequences to the actions of those that want to abuse the system and whitepapers with nifty websites don't cut it anymore.  As the market prepares for 2018, results will drive the market.  For ETH to remain strong, the ETH ecosystem needs dApps that are driving real world results, not hopes and dreams.  It's time to put up or shut up because the market is in a fog of Whitepaper Weariness as the pump and dump schemes begin to lose steam (i.e. the Sketchy Tezie, etc.).\n\nThe good news is that we really haven't seen a recent hype cycle on ETH or ALTs amidst the recent strength of BTC, but it should produce some interesting opportunities with anything tangible that hits the radar with real world results.  However, it's difficult to assume that we'll see a big wave based on the dev-heavy agenda of DC3 and will most likely produce a ho-hum bump at best.  The market is all eyes on S2x, regardless of DC3 results and if BTC (the symbol) gains strength post S2x with strong volume and clear direction, a strong DC3 will enhance the gains; until then, it may be marginal at best.  \n\n--------\n\nStrong Plays Ahead.\n\nWhile there are a lot of Decentralized Dreams flowing through the ecosystem, there remain a few strong plays that will drive growth in the market for the ecosystem in the short term:  Global platforms for Payments, Anonymity and Decentralized Markets.  For the traders and hodlers here, these will most likely become the strongest and most liquid segments to focus on aside from the upcoming K&Q milestones.  The key is focusing on the platforms that combine all three elements.  Payments are great, but the ecosystem will require anonymity and decentralized (aka \"free\") markets to exchange value with payment capabilities included.  This will become the key foundation for real world expansion across the globe to streamline the global crypto ecosystem beyond the thralls of centralized organizations.  While this has been a core focus of blockchain since the birth of BTC, it has been largely overshadowed by the GRQ (Get Rich Quick) age of ICOs.  Again, listen to the seasoned traders, as they've been very bullish on the chains that lead the charge in this regard.\n\n--------\n\nMaybe bet a feast, but never bet the farm.\n\nWe all believe that Bitcoin, Ethereum and select others will continue to provide extraordinary opportunities for profit over the long term, but we are definitely heading into some very choppy waters.  It's very easy to let the market get the best of us and hope that things will move a certain way, but much of the analysis can be clouded by emotion, greed, hubris, and everything else that can tear down the foundation of paper capital, so always remember to be cautious when the headwinds grow stronger.

In this scenario, the wave of new investors would drive the next x10 in market cap of the asset class as a whole. My LT strategy has been to be invested in what I\u2019ve been perceiving as being the bluechip assets within the space and overweight blockchains I believe have the most LT potential (i.e. Ethereum has been and is still my favourite pick when having my LT investor cap on).\n1 - Investors landscape\n\u201cTraditional\u201d investors of all types were represented at the conference. From right to left on the risk spectrum:\n(a) The pure players / new kids on the block: i.e. Polychain capital, Pantera capital (props to Joey Krug who I found to be very well articulated / quite impressive) and the likes.\n(b) Traditional VCs: Some of them already invested in the space (mostly through traditional means - i.e. equity in blockchain related companies, but some of them also directly invested in digital asset (Token issued by start-up they backed (a la Kik/Kin), bluechip digital asset such as ETH and KYC/AML compliant token such as Filecoin). All VCs I had a chat with had the intention to increase there exposure to blockchain asset (through direct investment in blockchain assets) in the future.\n(c) Private equity / Multi-Strat asset manager (i.e. Blackrock, KKR and the likes): Trying to get their heads around the asset class. Change in mentalities occurred this year, the asset class is seen as legitimate and more and more decision maker within these institutions are starting to buy into the narrative that blockchain assets are / will be an asset class in their own right (Just like emerging market became an asset class in the late 1980s or infrastructure over the last decade). Investors of that type I had the pleasure to talk with weren\u2019t ready to get direct exposure to the asset class (noting that some of them will get some limited indirect exposure through their VC allocation). My gut feel is that we\u2019re still couple of years away from them diversifying into the space in a material way (i.e. having blockchain asset at say 0.5%-1% of their book).\n(d) Pension funds: To my greatest surprise, some pension funds were in the room. Very early stage, but encouraging to see them taking notice of the emergence of this new asset class. Investment teams within pension funds having some level of understanding of the crypto value proposition and slowly getting comfortable with the asset class is crucial as a very significant part of the funds invested by (c) type of investors are on their behalf.\n2 - ICO craze\nAll investors I could talk with were in agreement that 90% of FY-17 ICOs will not deliver / go to zero on a long enough period of time.\nI see three types of ICOs:\n(A)- Scams / Money grab - i.e. Project ran by people that could be qualified to various extent of sociopath(s)\n(B) - Genuine teams trying to do great things but either a) Out of their depth technically b) Not able to come up with the right incentive structure (or clearly not structuring things around the right set of incentive in the first place - Which should be a key consideration when looking into potential capital appreciation any token) c) chasing wild-goose\n(C) - Success story in the becoming\nGoes without saying that most ICOs will end up falling in buckets 1&2.\n3 - Conclusion\nAll in all, super encouraging to see that the asset class is quickly maturing. Traditional investors are taking serious notice of its existence and significant amount of smart money is sitting on the side waiting for good entry points, ready to jump in into the right assets.

BTC is a lot more mainstream over the last couple of months, and the normie FOMO could last a while, oblivious to the fork.\n\nThat, and are we so certain the miners will be switching soon?  According to Coinwarz plenty of alt coins have had higher profitability than BTC yet they haven't received the same boon.  And, ironically, since yesterday the mining power of BCH has actually dropped from 470ish to 364.53 PH/s, and BTC has risen from 7200ish to 7,447.65 PH/s.  I too am inclined to believe profitability will win out in the long long run, but if the numbers hold long enough... could that not crash BCH right back down and cancel this whole thing?  After all, most BTC miners probably have a significant stack, vested emotional interest, and the knowledge that BTC crashing would hurt the entire crypto market.  Yes, Tragedy of the Commons may yet take place, but at the moment the risk/reward to the miners isn't there yet, and jumping ship would mean a lot of betrayal to their community.  At the least, we're gonna have to assume there'll need some time to sell their stacks before anyone moves rigs.   Who knows how long all that could take?\n\nSo in short:  I wouldn't underestimate \"dumb money\".  BTC has run on \"dumb money\" for a looooong time.

DM me your preferred address.", 1], ["2018-01-15 10:38:02", "No worries on the BAT, save it for testing!\n\nTo be honest, just super excited about your project, because options are a clear missing piece for helping to introduce stability and risk management in the crypto markets.  So your success here would be more than enough to be worth contributing feedback and time for me, and probably every crypto-trader that doesn't want to have to go through CBOE to manage their risk and exposure in the crypto markets.\n\n\nI think my deepest area of concern is the writers ability to modify options terms as the market changes.  If an OTC offer has to be created with gas, deleted with gas, and recreated with gas, then those transactions have to be priced into the premium and will require a lot of risk and effort for your makers.\n\nI think you could get a LOT of book depth and transactions if you allow covered call writers to express their pricing with variables instead of a fixed OTC offer.\n\nFor example, say I write a covered call on BAT with 7 days to expire and an ATM strike price.  BAT's price stays the same for the next 3 days, but I now have a covered call up open for sale with 4 days left with a 7 day time premium in its price.  I would need to reprice it to be attractive.  To do that, I need to kill the current contract and write another (incurring gas).\n\nIf you were to allow a covered call to be written, but expressed by a premium formula, you could allow those offers to stay valid longer.\n\nA simple example would be:\n\n1.) I write a covered call by sending 10 BAT to your contract with 7 days expiration.\n2.) In the data, I define a 0.0001 premium (fixed) + 0.00001 per day from exp. (variable).\n3.) In your front end, you would show 0.0001 + 0.00001 (x 7) = 0.00017 price per contract initially.\n4.) In 3 days, if the contract has not been filled, you'd be displaying 0.0001 + 0.00001 x (7 - 3) = 0.00014\n5.) If the contract is \"purchased,\" you'd run a check against days to expire in the contract data and price accordingly to the front end.\n\nBasically, setting a time decay would make the offers stay valid for longer.  You can accept, honor, and fulfill those by mirroring the functions on the front end and in the contract.\n\nA similar process could be used to make the one covered amount of BAT to produce multiple options offers from the same covered call writer by introducing a strike variable.\n\nSomething like:\n\n1.) I send 10 BAT to your contract and write a covered call.\n2.) I set the Strike Price at 0.005 ETH, the premium at 0.0001, the daily decay at 0.00001, and then add an OTM multiplier to price the same call at multiple strike prices.  \n\nSimple Example:  (1 + abs((SPg - SPc)  / SPg)) x OTM x Premium + (Daily Decay x Days-to-Expire) + IF_Negative((SPg - SPc,0)\n\nWhere SPg = Strike Price given, SPc = Strike Price you calculate.\n\nThe above makes it so I can give one Strike Price, a Time Decay, and a pricing function for how to price the call at different strike prices.  From there, my 10 BAT could be offered at multiple strike prices and expiration windows on the same transaction (allowing you to fill an entire order book, strike price depth, and expiration calendar, with valid call options from a single call writer).\n\nLast, if you can provide an oracle with a generally accepted and updated quote for BAT's price (or allow for a state channel to accept that as an input from a call writer), you can add the last variable for price in there, and allow options writers to express their offers at deltas from the current underlying price. \n\nLast Example:  (1 + abs((SPoracle - SPc)  / SPoracle)) x OTM x Premium + (Daily Decay x Days-to-Expire) + IF_Negative((SPoracle - SPc,0)\n\nWhere SPoracle = the current price of BAT.\n\nThat would let a BAT holder send in say 10 Million BAT, which can go in and be priced differently for every Strike Price and Expiration Date, and be fine keeping it there even if there is volatility in BAT's price (because the options offers will change accordingly).\n\nAt the contract level, it's adding a few variables to the contract struct, but still a single transaction.  On the front end, you're just using those variables to display multiple calculations to make multiple offers.  One contract purchase just removes 1 BAT from all the offers.\n\nIf you can get there, a call writer can drop in any amount BAT, help you make a large market with multiple call options, and pretty much never have to worry about recreating OTC offerings consistently and paying for more gas if contracts don't sell.\n", 1], ["2018-01-16 00:52:14", "These are great ideas!

The only way for a hacker to get this, would be through the printer's memory of a computer that was used to print out this wallet. This then means the hacker either has physical access to the wallet, printer, or computer - or was using a RAT (basically a malicious TeamViewer). Said person, also had their 2FA 'breached', or at least that's what the general consensus was for their Bittrex account.\n\n\n\n2) Considering example number one, there is a little more information making comparisons between the cases. This leads me to believe that a RAT was also used, through a potential number of different ways, which allowed the hacker(s) to gain access to the 2FA. The unusual thing is that from the link, he stated they disabled the 2FA upon immediately. Why would they do this if they'd managed to breach the exchange, or, had access to his 2FA on his phone? They wouldn't. They didn't have access to the next 2FA code in the next 30 seconds, to make the withdrawal, hence why they disabled it. This then means his computer was compromised, with a RAT (as stated above).\n\n\nThere are a few takeaways from these scenarios.\n\n1) Someone may have created/found a loop hole for common anti-viruses (known as a 0-day exploit), which installs a RAT unknowingly.\n\n2) He may have been compromised by a phishing attack, where his entered 2FA was used, seconds after by the hacker on the real website.\n\n3) An organisation (NSA, Russian/north-korean groups) are potentially looking to exploit as many cryptocurrency vulnerabilities (users, and or exchanges), to boost their economic stance on the upcoming economic boom that the crypto world represents. They're the exact type of organisations to leave a series of breadcrumbs suggesting one thing, concealing the actual vulnerability from my above analysis. \n\n\nTLDR; The safest way is to create a cold storage wallet, off the internet, on a computer that hasn't, and will never be, connected to the internet, accompanied with a hardware wallet.", 3], ["2017-08-25 18:39:30", "Well fuck.

These smart contracts are incentivized to continue operation autonomously via network transaction fees, which is ultimately reliant upon the underlying blockchain (e.g. Ethereum) to enforce transactional state transitions.\n\nWe propose a method for decentralized autonomous applications to scale to process not only financial activity, but also construct economic incentives for globally persistent data services, which may produce an alternative to centralized server farms.\n\nPlasma is composed of two key parts of the design: Reframing all blockchain computation into a set of MapReduce functions, and an optional method to do Proof-of-Stake token bonding on top of existing blockchains with the understanding that the Nakamoto Consensus incentives discourage block withholding.\n\nThis construction is achieved by composing smart contracts on the main blockchain using fraud proofs whereby state transitions can be enforced on a parent blockchain. We compose blockchains into a tree hierarchy, and treat each as an individual branch blockchain with enforced blockchain history and MapReducable computation committed into merkle proofs. By framing one's ledger entry into a child blockchain which is enforced by the parent chain, one can enable incredible scale with minimized trust (presuming root blockchain availability and correctness).\n\nThe greatest complexity around global enforcement of non-global data revolves around data availability and block withholding attacks, Plasma has mitigations for this issue by allowing for exiting faulty chains while also creating mechanisms to incentivize and enforce continued correct execution of data.\n\nAs only merkleized commitments are broadcast periodically to the root blockchain (i.e. Ethereum) during non-faulty states, this can allow for incredibly scalable, low cost transactions and computation. Plasma enables persistently operating decentralized applications at high scale.", 9], ["2017-08-11 16:53:04", "Remember that this is an aside to the end goal of sharding as well.", 3], ["2017-08-11 00:16:04", "The return to .15 (and ultimately the further ascent to .30) is ~~inevitable~~ *seemingly* inevitable. \n\nI don't think however that Plasma of itself can (and will) trigger a more immediate return. It's too foundational, and cryptomarkets rarely price in *positive* fundamentals quickly.\n\nRather, the first application which can meaningfully and practically operate *because* of Plasma *and attract mainstream attention* will trigger both a new wave of investment, attention from corporate players, and begin the network effect. If I'm understanding it correctly, Plasma *by itself* is even less impactful than Raiden even though the opportunities it brings and overall desirability are much more. Raiden solves and immediate single need in the cryptoworld, with possible complementing systems and uses down the line; Plasma allows you to solve any previously blocktime-bound smart contract scenario but is no single problem driving its creation. Raiden is an obviously useful feature to the lay person, while Plasma is an enormously useful feature to the technically inclined. \n\nI think the functionality of Plasma will bring more value (and ultimately more attention) than the EC20 contract.

This is what the BTC chart is trying to say and BTC continues to lead the market.  https://www.tradingview.com/x/u3nj52ny\n\nByzantium node updates begin next week ahead of the HF on the 17th; DevCon comes early November and S2X at the end of November.  Needless to say, this could be the most crucial period for the crypto ecosystem that we have seen this year (or perhaps ever) and it should give us a very clear picture of what the coming year(s) will look like - continued growth or dark and stormy waters.  As stated before, a lot of stars need to line up to continue the bullish outlook after all the FUD of July and September.  The market has seen an extraordinary run this year and now the market expects to see results for ETH and a clear outlook for whatever becomes the leading BTC.  \n\nA few concepts as we look ahead to the next 90 days:\n(1) It appears that BTC will be bound between $4,000 and $4,500 in the short term on low volume.  Any break above or below will be based on ETH strength/weakness and any leading 2x news.\n(2) ETH has been holding very steady above $285 support (just above $300 currently) and may trend up to $350-$400 leading up to the fork if all signs are positive next week with node updates.  A positive Byzantium upgrade will be the first positive sign for ETH and related tokens heading into DevCon, which we all know will add to hype and speculation before and during the event as the market learns what's new.  \n(3) This DevCon will be particularly crucial for the ETH-related ecosystem and the market is expecting to see real progress - any signs of weakness in development timelines, product releases, etc may very well put a damper on all things ETH.  \n(4) To 2x or not.  That is anyone's guess at this point as both sides are stuck.  The Billion Dollar question:  What becomes the \"real\" BTC and will the market support it.  There is literally billions of dollars at stake here and the big players (aside from the obvious figureheads) are unusually quiet.  What we do know is that most of the main players of the NYA are still holding strong, which means that S2X is not going away yet.  Segwit integration has been doggedly slow, which may be a sign that the market is not wasting its time to upgrade to Segwit when 2x is just around the corner and gives them everything they wanted.  The Core crowd was hoping that Segwit integration would solve most of the scaling/fee issues (Lighting Network, etc) ahead of 2x so that 2x would become unnecessary, but it doesn't appear that too many have moved in their direction.  \n(5) BTC Fork Predictions:  In any market, it's generally a good strategy to follow the money.  The ecosystem that we've seen develop hinges around BTC's success for the foreseeable future and the big players aren't going to let their foundation crumble.  My prediction is that this becomes a non-event and we'll start to see signs of it weeks ahead of the proposed fork.  If the 2x players see 2x isn't the winning side, most will make their move ahead of the fork, drop out of the NYA and the fork will create another small chain.   However, because of all the money behind the big players that are still committed to the NYA, it's safe to say that if they continue to show support, 2x has a very real chance to become the strongest chain.  Miners and exchanges will lead the charge while developers hands will be forced to move to the winning side.  If I'm wrong and there is a contentious divide with no clear winner, it will get very ugly and we'll see a long-term bear trend across the entire industry.  All that new money waiting to come in will dry up until the ecosystem shows signs of healing that will take months/years.  It can very well happen, but it's hard to imagine that either side wants to see the Bitcoin ecosystem implode for the sake of ideological scaling solutions.\nEdit:  Chart link.", 27], ["2017-10-03 22:47:09", "Looks like we're floating around in this range for the time being, but we should expect to see a soft bounce from these levels in the near term. We're bottomed out on 3-hr RSI (on low volume) and still in the middle of the range of the run on the 1D charts, but with early August-like weakness across ALTs. \n\nThe target of $6000 BTC by YE is starting to be thrown around, but it's difficult to predict the outcomes pre/post fork. ETH should pull ahead against BTC if Metropolis and DevCon go well. Targets of $600-650 by YE have been popping up recently, which would only be possible with a strong break above $400. Those targets aren't out of the realm of possibility, but a lot of stars need to align to make that happen. \n\nThis low volume environment feels similar to the pre-BCH fork and if there's some clear positive direction for the BTC UASF that lines up with Metropolis, then those targets could be the catalyst for the next run. It feels like everyone is just waiting around looking for some signal either way, so the sideways movement is probably the trend for the next several days/weeks, barring any major events on either side of the coin. \n\nTL;DR. The sentiment appears to be gearing up for a test of lower support levels until the BTC/ETH events occur.

In a negative feedback loop, liquidation of margin longs in alts would be even faster.\n\nApart selling BTC and longs in general what do I recommend \uff1fThe listing of the CST make a interesting dynamic where buying the cheapest token seems the better risk reward trade because of the asymmetric payoff whether you believe or not in a particular outcome. \n\nThere might be also some monstrous arbitrage opportunities depending on what other exchanges decide.

Thus expecting movement upwards if no dip occurs on 30th of September. \n\n\n\nIf we do dip down then... dip buyers will just keep the price on same-what ok levels ($250-270ish). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", 15], ["2017-10-01 22:46:02", "did everyone die?", 13], ["2017-10-02 13:21:56", "Purmabull...not sure what that means exactly. Frankly, it's hard to tell what this market is other than very unique. \n\nWhat is easier to understand is that this market is ripe with opportunity. The short term needles do affect day to day trading strategies ripe with emotional FUD/hype. However, the longer term perspective with protective measures, TA indicators, and sentiment make a significant difference in the perspective of short and long term traders. \n\nThe discovery of new frontiers requires a certain fortitude that isn't for everyone. There's always a risk, but the key is to always be cognizant of the undercurrents. \n\nThe tea leaves of these forums are a tale of two cities: the doomsdayers and moonslayers.  When either camp is strong, it's a sure sign we're at a ST turning point (read the past threads from the lows and highs to understand more...It's really helpful to reflect on past sentiment). When it's quiet, it's a time to reflect and research what's going on across the horizon to see which way the next current is going to lead the market. \n\nAt the end of the day, the goal is to take advantage of the bigger picture. Example, Warren Buffet invested $5Bln into GS in 2008. 2008?! Yes. He invested when it was seemingly the worst time to invest.  A small $3.2bln profit over 4.5 yrs. Not bad.  (http://fortune.com/2013/03/28/what-buffett-deal-says-about-goldman-sachs/)\n\nAre we in a 2008 crypto era? Not exactly, but that's how good investors make money. When the storms hit (big or small), smart investors take advantage of it. In July and September alone, we saw some of the most FUD since 2013/14 and the DAO/BFX hacks of '16 --- but all legitimate concerns. Government regulation of trading, exchanges, ICOs, and everything under the sun (ie Tulips and Ponzi schemes). What did we see? Consolidation and support. \n\nWhen people lead us down this road time and time again, read all the headlines of the past. The world of crypto isn't living in the basements anymore. It's hitting mainstream, which also means that the wheat will be separated from the chaff. The poorly managed and scammy projects will be met with fierce scrutiny, but the strongest teams and communities will earn a seat at the table. Invest in teams, not fleeting ideas. \n\nIf you want to day trade, use a bot so you don't get emotional about bull/bear sentiment. It's a great side job to a make a few bucks to pay the bills. However, if you want to make real money, do the research and commit yourself to the fact that this market is real and will change the way the world thinks about money.  Invest long term and adjust accordingly. Learn how to invest in the projects built on merit, not hype. \n\nFor now, BTC (fork or otherwise) is leading the charge. Whether we like it or not, the big boys are controlling the game, but eventually it'll lead to some extraordinarily unique opportunities for those that are looking to change the way the system works. The market will follow the leader as adoption takes hold. One can either sit it out or figure out how to ride the train in first class. \n\nThere's more to crypto than day to day market trading. Find a project to work on, build a business with blockchain, do something that makes a difference, but by all means, don't spend all of your time trying to figure out the exact direction of the weather day to day. Weather forecasters are wrong a lot and if you live life by the weather of the day, you won't enjoy much, but if you live regardless of the weather, the sun will shine eventually (but you may need to move if you want more sun;). \n\nWe all live in a system of our own making and the only way to freedom is to let go of everything from that system that holds us back. \n\nEnd rant.

Since ZEC builds on old btc architecture, it is slower and also will never be nearly as anonymous as Monero, which has a strong dev community and is incredible solid and safe. So the counter-argument would be: why even bother with ZEC, when you have Monero? I feel sympathetic towards ZEC and really hope for them to further improve, but this fact is difficult to argue with. The only valid and important argument in favor of ZEC in this case is that the increase in privacy with Monero is more theoretical and for hypothetical purposes. For the normal user and current state of the art computer power, ZEC is as safe as Monero. So it is also about adoption. But also here, I can't make out who is currently the winner.\n\nOne last point, however, regarding short-term ZEC trading: Monero just went way up.

I really hope those getting involved elsewhere are taking short term trader mentalities rather than investing.\n\nThe big red flag for me is seeing XRP hit >$1; this money is super dumb (XRP shares = great, XRP token = not so hot) and I'm not in the business of chasing FOMO in dumb money.\n\nI've moved very little in the last 6 months at great opportunity cost (EOS, BTC, MKR and a select few others give me some regret) but at the same time I believe the markets will eventually consolidate into quality projects; even if that means a significant correction across the board.\n\n...\n\n**Note the following:** \n\nThe next year looks incredible for ETH in terms of liquidity and economics; \n\n- Increasing public awareness (network effect catch up + public educating themselves better).\n\n- PoS implementation very likely (passive income for a growing non-speculative potentially essential asset will appeal to institutional investors + this will reduce inflation and lead to massive supply lockup on a background of increasing demand for ETH/gas).\n\n- Sharding/working scalability solutions (both on/off chain) will likely mature with further deployments.\n\n- dAPP releases.\n\n- Ethfinex and decentralized exchanges running on ETH will encourage growth/pumps in ETH and it's ecosystem of ERC20 tokens; these are in ETHfinex's best interests after all to see the market grow and if you believe the tether rumours (I do) I don't see why this won't happen.\n\n- The potential impact of DAI stable coins in causing ETH to be locked up by the makerDAO (liquidity squeeze combined with PoS will dramatically reduce circulating ETH supply). The potential demand for stablecoins is massive especially in jurisdictions such as the UK where you aren't taxed per trade but on conversion to fiat only. \n\n- Thus even in a large scale market wide correction; I struggle to see ETH being undervalued for very long; if anything we are just getting started. For me that makes selling very difficult ***even on 8000% appreciation in under 2 years.***\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI cannot stress that cryptocurrency trading provides the kind of accessibility, volatility and returns to the middle classes that stocks, savings, bonds and other more traditional financial instruments cannot provide. In the UK health service we are bitter over years of effective pay cuts, assaults on our pension plan (devaluations, changing goal posts), media campaigns that have attempted to discredit our worth and professional standing, GBP devaluation and near zero percent interest rates on savings with under performing indexes that offer no light of any real social mobility. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt takes 5 minutes to open a coinbase account. It took me almost a week to open a brokerage account and the movements in those assets are sluggish (a year of stocks feels like a few days in crypto). Crypto by it's nature is almost purely speculative, has a narrower asset range (1500 tokens vs hundred of thousands of registered mainstream stocks) and is surprisingly easier to understand, evaluate and move positions in and out of than traditional asset classes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBears; keep that in mind.", 14], ["2017-12-22 10:45:01", "Two rumors this week big ones, no confirmation on them leading to think it was fake and now massive selloff.

The noobies having no idea that BCH was trading in the 3000's on all other exchanges would be complaining and thinking they need to blame someone else when they paid $5000 to much. \nNo one likes to take responsibility for their own actions. Seeing that it was getting out of hand, not allowing for the order book to fill up before they turn on trading, is just an accident waiting to happen at coinbase. The large exchanges I prefer to trade on would never let something like that happen. I have been assuming (my mistake) that coinbase would know the risk of the next coin they add would be a melt up. Shame on coinbase for not foreseeing this. Maybe they should have consulted some of us. All I can say is that was complete gradeschool on coinbase's part.\n\n There are many ways to add some order at times like this. One way would be to limit the trade size.  Another would be to allow the order book to fill. Another way would be to turn on 4 coins at once to create some supply. Most noobies would not have the money to buy four  I am assuming. Never the less it was a bad move. So now I suspect we will see a similar upside move today on BCH. Now we have time for everyone and the news channels (cnbc) to tell the world coinbase is adding BCH.

This is personal preference, but I'm a firm believer that crypto is way too volatile to even consider it. One thing I'd encourage is the following:\n\n1) Before you enter a trade, figure out what you're wanting from it. Is this a short-term trade, medium, or long-term?\n\n2) Identify your risk threshold. Are you someone who gets weak hands? If so, I'd consider lowering the % of stack you invest in a single trade. I'd also consider making an exit strategy. If you really want to set stop loss orders, I'd suggest tiering them, as crypto has a tendency to bounce a lot, and if you're selling everything at one price, may miss out on a lot of profit had you tiered the sells (due to the price bouncing after it triggered the stop loss). \n\n\n3) Personal preference again, but depending on what timeframe you've sent from question 1, should dictate how much of your stack you're willing to trade with. In my opinion, the longer the timeframe, the larger percentage of your stack you should be trading. IE the longer you're invested based on pure fundamentals, the more risk tolerance we get really have as humans. If you make a day trade, and don't believe in the fundamental coin, you're far more likely to get weak hands. This also helps manage risk. For instance, because day trading can be volatile, you want lots of smaller trades (in terms of % of your stack), because it will give you more opportunity to abuse the market if things go wrong on the first trade. However, if you invest 100% of your stack in a short term move, and something happens, well you can see what happens. If you do have knowledge abovw the average investor, why would you not want to expose yourself to a high number of trades, over long amounts of time? Aversely, if you consider yourself a weak trader, stick to fundamentals and generally hold medium-long term, so that your decisions are rational and not knee jerk reactions. \n\n\n4) Once you've figured out your timeframe, try and think about the profit margin you want. If you're expecting a coin to go up 5%, once you've bought it, set a limit sell order for the expected price. With this, you also need an exit strategy. If you're having trouble sticking to plans you've made, I suggest writing down your plan for the trade (IE but ETH St $300USD, sell at $315USD within the next two days, hold long term of it doesn't work, or maybe consider tiered selling at $275). This is obviously an example, but setting a timeframe, and clear strategy on paper will help you make clear, rational decisions under future pressure.\n\nHope this helps, and remember: never risk money you can't afford to lose, and never see mistakes as bad. These are perfect opportunities for learning, so the next time a similar scenario comes around, you're there to snatch up with both hands. Happy trading!

Storage space is so incredibly cheap (due to a lack of users), that the entire Siacoin space is overvalued (incredibly so) at this current moment in time.  If you wanted to make the argument that Siacoin will never reach a point where the userbase and the fees to use their storage service will ever turn a profit, then yes I would actually agree with you.

First you have to understand that you can actually purchase Siacoins or Siafunds.  Siacoin is more akin to Ether in that it's the currency used to pay for storage, while Siafund holders receive a 3.9% fee on the storage costs of each file contract.  There are only 10,000 Siafunds in existence, and they can no longer be purchased, except directly from a current Siafund owner.

It's just my personal belief, but I like reading the ingredients and supporting businesses with my money that work within my own ethical framework.

Key strengths are existing client base in the millions, industry validity because Kik was already a unicorn, backers including union square ventures, Polychain, Pantera, and Blockchain Capital, and an ambitious scope which is a double-edged sword. Key risks are implementation because the scope of their vision may have an amount of transactions that are impractical without sharding or a true up to the mainnet, they may be raising these funds due to stalled growth and a plateau in user acquisition, hedge funds will own about half of the coin, Kin might be a redundant concept since there are already widely accepted coins.\n\nUltimately my main reason to buy, for me, was that it is an ICO published by a respectable company and is a significant step forward for the ETH community and the silicon valley community alike. If Spotify or another large tech start-up does an ICO, then people will point to Kik as the first peer of theirs to move in that direction. Also in my thesis is that there is pent-up demand for the ICO due to the strict KYC measures.

The competitive nature of humans makes me feel users would want that number one spot and keep the deposits to their Prisms coming. Remember, the Leader Board is based on gains in ETH, not percentages.  \nI consider their fees to be a convenience factor. You could grill a nice steak complete with all the trimmings at home as opposed to dining in a restaurant. Dining out though saves you a trip to the butcher, grocer, prep and cook time with no clean-up in the end. And the difference there is a lot greater than 2.4%.  \n\nShapeShift works on the same premise with their higher fees. It's a quick and easy way to exchange assets but yes, it will cost you more and there are limits. Their target markets are similar if not the same, another smart move on their part.  \n\nHere's an interesting fact on ShapeShift and the value of their transactions dating back to 2015:  \n\nDecember 2015 - $1.6M in tx\nDecember 2016 - $20M in tx\nMay 2017 - $210M in tx\n\n\n\n", 2], ["2017-09-28 16:21:54", "https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2017/06/01/prism-fee-update\n\nLooks like 1% monthly fee is gone unless they have a more recent update that i couldn't find (unless you're speaking from beta experience, in which case oops), 1% monthly fee was stupidly insane no matter if they were justified or not.\n\nAlso regarding leaderboards i think it gives them some room to play around with things like putting money towards the portfolio owners to access their portfolio if they wanted to share.", 2], ["2017-06-15 04:28:39", "Likewise! I love your assemblies and appreciate the open dialogues about them.\n\nTo me it's not a horse race. So I consider their leaderboard just for amusement. But as you say, humans have a competitive nature. I find the combo of those two a bit dangerous. Considering it's still early stage for a lot of things happening today. But I'm pretty sure It will work in their advantage and hopefully for the ones - who know how to read the gains based on ETH - too.\n\nI most definitely see the convenience factor. I don't argue that. That's why I pointed that I'm the type of trader that loves to go to the butcher, hear about good steak and it's orgin, prepares it at home, makes his own hotsause and hopefully doesn't ruin it on the bbq when I leave it unattended to get a new beer :) ...and yes, I do like good restaurants too.\n\nI was just curious for who the convenience will benefit most. I've read them saying their focus group is starters/newcomers. There's a lot to say about any type without a right or wrong. Think the newcomers who transform into panic buyers is a good market for them. Apart from experienced traders who would love to have a good decent meal on their plate with no hassle.\n\nPS: As for a future weekly recommendation: I would love to hear your findings and opinion about Tezos.\n\nCheers!", 2]]}, "268": {"created": "2017-05-28 12:23:31", "title": "[ALTCOIN ASSEMBLY WEEKLY] May 28, 2017", "num_comments": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "comments": [["2017-05-28 22:08:24", "Thanks for a very informative post.

Building an ERC20 collateral backed peer-to-peer lending product\n\nIn parallel, we have been evaluating and designing a trustless peer-to-peer lending product which enables borrowers to use ERC20 digital tokens as collateral for an ETH or USD denominated loan (the latter paid out via ETH, and in the future via stablecoins).\n\nToday, many people hold various ERC20 tokens because they believe these will either be useful in the future, or they will appreciate in value. However, huge amounts of tokens just \u201clie there\u201d in wallets providing no value, even though they could serve as a basis for credit. This would be analogous to Securities Based Lending in the traditional financial system.\n\nERC20 tokens (and other forms of tokenized assets, in the future) can become a new form of secure, low friction lending. The use of collateral serves as a safety net against default and eliminates the need to interact with a globally fragmented credit rating system. Borrowers can range from long term cryptocurrency holders, to startup founders who are \u201ctoken rich\u201d, but need access to funds for expenses. This service would appeal to a wide range of general debt investors and crypto investors who want to diversify their gains, due to the reduced default risk enabled by collateral held via smart contract. We\u2019ve been working on the detailed mechanics and business use-cases of the product these past few weeks, and will have more to share regarding the detailed mechanics, in our next update.\n\nIf we go the peer-to-peer lending route, we plan to open source the project in its entirety. Regardless of the path we take for our next product, we will consider a \u201cbuy & burn\u201d mechanism of TRST tokens using any fees charged by the platform as a method to reduce token supply and benefit the entire WeTrust community.", 2], ["2017-05-29 21:15:46", "Exactly!

Looks like they haven't adjusted it for a while or probably not at all since version 1.\n\nI could write down a complete essay about it. But that would be focussed too much on minor details and personal ethics. But I will name a few that kept me busy (as some haven't become clear yet). \n\nFor instance, that their \u2018trusted lending circle\u2019 is based on auctions and lotteries. Where 'successful lending groups' eventually get appointed to auctions more often than others. Which will eventually give those groups more sayings/power in approvals and loans within the whole circle (So much for the equality principle - behind the scenes that is).\n\nAlso some contradictions. Like:\"Trustcoin is not an investment and should not be purchased as an investment\". Which makes you wonder how come they have a token anyway. Let's say that this is bad copywriting before the crowdfunding started. 'Donation' would have been a better choice of words here in that case. Still it remains unclear to me If they want to expand and enter other exchanges or not. I only found Trustcoin on Bittrex so far.\n\nThe statement that '2 billion adults in this world don't have a bank account' probably/also means they don't have an option/tool to enter the Trusted Lending Circle either. Unless it is via a third party, which they try to avoid according to their vision. How will that be taken care of? \n\nThe WeTrust People Ecosystem.\nThey say there are four essential parties. General Users, Sponsors and Forepersons.\nNot sure if I missed it somewhere else but where/who is the fourth party in this Ecosystem?\n\nBut again, this Whitepaper (and all it's lacks) was specifically written mainly for the crowdfunding (at least, I hope). When I read their blogs afterwards, they make good progress and good improvements where necessary. And some things made more sense too.\n\n...So far for the sceptic part :)\n\nTheir vision is great. And their product has great potential also. Achieving their release deadlines of 'Intermediate ROSCA' and 'Advanced ROSCA' will be key. If they nail this, they will lift off on rapidly increased attention and interest in early 2018. \n\nAlso they need to expand on different/more exchanges if you ask me. Like Kraken and Poloniex. That will give them more credibility towards the industry they rely on. Though I haven't read about it anywhere on what their plans/strategy is on that matter. Except they start in the USA. (While their key focus targets on countries as India, China and Latin America). Perhaps It's a wise thing to do. Can't tell to be honest.\n\nAnd most important. They need a good use-case. Maybe two. Set a good strategy and go big on it. The financial and insurance industry is a real hard mountain to conquer, that's a given fact. Same goes for gaining users which they also depend on heavily.\n\nReally hope they can show and prove their product to the world. They still have a big road ahead but so far it looks good. And I'll be keeping a close look on their progress. Also I really would like to see them enter on the earlier mentioned exchanges. Different crypto wallets are adopting Trustcoin already. So that looks promising!\n\nMy conclusion: If the ROSCA releases go as planned (which gains Trust) I would definitely make an investment for at least two years at the point I'm looking at it right now.\n\nPS: Feel free to enlighten me where you guys think I'm wrong or way off track.", 1], ["2017-05-31 11:12:43", "Thanks u/PopcornSupply.

Will it correlate to and magnify the greater market crash, or will it profit off it / hold its value?\n\nGuess that's always been the question, but it was interesting to hear it posed that way, and for me to not really have an answer one way or the other.  Crypto is one of those weird things that could be seen as both a deflationary, relatively stable holder of wealth, and also a highly speculative and risky asset that many normal stock brokers might only include a small percentage of their portfolio in - and dump in a market-wide crash.\n\nSo which is it?  Long term, I'd lean the former: Bitcoin and other deflationary currencies should at least function as a Better Gold.  Short term though - little actual value.  Still have my doubts it would do too badly in a market crash though...  We have seen so many microcosms of this play out within the crypto space alone though, where a Bitcoin crash brings everything down - and it tends to be USD that wins those, with BTC holding its value best, but I can't say I know how it would play out against the greater market.  Big question is now just how correlated are the two markets?  How have they done in the past, and what could we expect?  Looking at NASDAQ vs BTC, I'm not even sure where to start answering those questions, but they do seem to have some positive correlatation, certainly this last 4 months.

However, the Chinese market is one of the biggest in the world. There is a lot of money to be made. And it oftentimes works differently from the West/Rest of the World, which may be due to language barriers as well as cultural and - foremost - political reasons. Several examples: eBay and Amazon don't play a role in China, Alibaba virtually takes up the entire market. Similarly, Google has a marketshare like bing does in the West. Everyone uses \"Baidu\". And thats where Neo may come into play, too. In sum, I regard it as a potentially great investment opportunity. Something to keep an eye on.

I got in pretty early at ~1.6-1.7 and have held my core position there since.  Not planning on trading it unless we have an obscene rally that forces me to change my plans.  Bought simply on the likely demand that Chinese nationalism will generate for a Chinese public protocol.  it's now my second largest position after ethereum, simply from appreciation, as I only started investing & trading cryptos a few months ago.  i've debated selling out of it, but I'm fairly confident that the upside in the next 2-3 years is where Ethereum is now, in which case we're looking at another 20-40x imo.  \n\npublic protocol has much more upside than blockchain startups.  protocols can have thousands of startups plug in to their network, and if x% succeed, the network succeeds.  the various ICO startups on the other hand, have to overcome adoption either on a corporate or consumer level, and beat out existing competition.  there are many good bets based on blockchain's value prop for specific industries, but many are extremely speculative right now.  i'm more comfortable putting/holding significant money in to ethereum, NEO, bitcoin etc. or blockchain alternatives like IOTA, than I am for companies/ICOs like augur, factom, OMG, aragon, and a few others that i like.  \n\nThey're still in the early stages, but they've made some decent progress in building a network & are now actively working on building the ecosystem and supporting startups and (probably) future ICOs on the NEO chain.  \n\nanecdotally, transactions on NEO are insanely fast, but that could simply be due to the fact that there are few if any actual use cases for NEO that could clog the network.  \n\nit looks like we're consolidating in the 15-20 range right now.  If we establish another baseline there, I think it's one of the better buys among alt coins for the mid-long term.  NEO may have just doubled, but I don't see it crashing during a crypto-wide bull run that i think we're in for the next month or two.  \n\ni'm not particularly good at trading, but my strength lies in identifying long-term value and identifying companies/cryptos that are positioning themselves successfully for the future, so don't listen to me for short-term trading advice.  but for a buy and hold mentality of >1 year, NEO is a very solid buy imo.  added value for holding NEO is that you will also accrue GAS in a your private wallet (not on the exchanges, except binance), which recently cracked the top 100 coins and is currently trading at $10+", 2], ["2017-08-12 06:36:12", "There was guy who posted a pic of him having used a tenX card in restaurant in ethtrader a couple of months ago.

This could be a powerful tool for increasing liberty in the world.\n\nIn 2014, a group of bankers formed a company called Blockstream with the goal of removing the \"peer-to-peer electronic cash\" aspect, changing Bitcoin into a settlement layer for third-party payment processors. Blockstream intends to make money by being one of those third-party payment processors. Their primary tools for changing Bitcoin into just a settlement layer are an \"enhancement\" called segregated witness (SegWit), along with a steadfast refusal to lift the temporary anti-spam blocksize limit. They have used censorship in the forums to stifle all debate, and thus managed to convince a lot (hard to say exactly how many) of people to go along with their plan.\n\nMany of the long-time bitcoiners are opposed to this change in direction, but most of them have been banned by the censors from the discussion in /r/bitcoin. So, people decided to fork off a version that does not include SegWit, but does immediately lift the blocksize limit. That version is Bitcoin Cash, to emphasize the return to the original idea of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\nThe \"big blockers\" do not agree with the direction taken by the hijackers, and they won't even allow us to participate in the discussion, so BCH has essentially filed for divorce. Hopefully, each group can now go in our separate directions and not have to deal with the others any more.\n\nBasics/Why BCH still has potential despite not having \"Segwit\":\n\nLightning Network is the settlement layer that will be built on top of SegWit.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash chain will probably also get its own version of the Lighting Network, but built on top of FlexTrans.\nThere are numerous advantages to FlexTrans over SegWit, but the primary sticking point is that Blockstream designed SegWit to get a discounted storage rate over regular on-chain transactions.\nNote that big blockers are not opposed to off-chain scaling, as long as it competes against on-chain scaling on a level playing field.\n\nCheers :)", 8], ["2017-08-08 06:14:14", ">\"currently 55% more profitable to mine on BTC than BCH\" ~ coindance\n\nmaybe this is the flippening", 2], ["2017-08-08 21:35:24", "if that happens short BTC and long BCH  u/huntingisland[  what is your take on this...", 1], ["2017-08-15 08:56:27", "So exciting, will be buying a bit every month.

In the last two years, conferences have gone from passionate techies to professional pursuit. The game has changed very quickly and this conference that had maybe a few hundred people a year ago with almost no mainstream attendance saw over 4,000 attendees and investors from across the globe. The fire has just been lit and will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhy $1T by Q1-18? Purely the FOMO cycle. There are so many great projects coming online that are considerably cheap in the realm of crypto valuations (more on those projects shortly). Every cycle we have seen in the last 18-24 months continues to grow stronger with an inevitable consolidation at ~40-50% of the GMC ATH (GMC is Global Market Cap, not a GM brand). One key indicator that is a great place to DCA in is when BTCUSD reaches the 1D RSI level of low 30s. Yes, everybody knows that, which is why we didn't hit it last week, but it's most likely coming regardless, which means that we should most likely test a double bottom in the low 9ks. Can we go lower? Yes we can, but will we? Probably not. We may float around in a range for 1-2 more weeks at the most, but the truth of the market is that the bubble is relatively small, institutional money is just getting in because of the volatility, and very few investors (<1mmm) own more than one Bitcoin, let alone any other coins. The hype isn't over; it's just taking a breather from the massive run-up in December. This is just a necessary reset.\n\nGreat Small Cap Projects: WAX, VEE, BAT, POE, GRID, AION, ARK, Popchest, and many more (please do your research). We are invested in most of these, but there are a few that we are either preparing to invest in or investing more because of the key factors: great leadership AND teams, strong development teams that are REAL, potential for future scalability/utility, and the ability to solve a real world problem that REQUIRES blockchain as a solution (not all of them do).\n\nAlarms: As always, there are a lot of projects/ICOs that have great stories/whitepapers, but have only one or two developers and lack the ability (human resources or otherwise) to deliver the promise and/or scalability. Development resources are very, VERY thin now and it's impossible to meet the ever increasing demand in the short term. There are some solutions out there to make blockchain development scalable the way that web development has become, but that is not coming anytime soon, so go with the best teams with seasoned developers.\n\nCore Hodlings: BTC/BCH and ETH should always be there, regardless of the FUD. BTC, regardless of politics, will continue to be strong in the distant future and will somehow solve the current scalability/political problems until it doesn't and is overtaken. Until then, it's still core to the ecosystem regardless of opinion. BCH is the faster/cheaper version of BTC, so it's a very good idea to keep it in core because if Roger is betting his stack on it, it's probably not a bad idea that we do to. ETH is the Microsoft/Apple/Google of blockchain with more Dapps AND developers than any other blockchain platform.

Adoption takes a long time. The Ethereum network will always be the favorite, just as BTC is (despite having so many forks).\n\nIt brings up a good thought experiment though.

Costs were therefore more predictable on an hour-to-hour basis.  Now, during any given hour, the agency may pay substantially more or less for a megawatt-hour of power than it charges its members.

The tech will get there eventually (even though scaling is still a big question mark). \nBut we still don't know if crypto can really make money obsolete. If it can do that depends mainly on mainstream adoption. Enabling fast private feeless transactions all over the globe are cool, but pretty useless if you can't pay anywhere with your new money system.\n\nBitcoin has the main advantage of being the first mover in the space, which gives it a lot of mainstream exposure and hype.

(Best example is 3d-printing. Even though the tech and patents are all there since the 80s, the revolution in rapid prototyping is only just happening now because the hype is there and people care about new solutions).\n\nThat is why Bitcoin gets all this press and why even though there is a new shit show around it every few months, people react by thinking \"huh so this didn't kill it, it seems very resilient\" and buy more.\nIn order to succeed mid-term Bitcoin does not need to be good at anything, it just needs to survive the next 2-3 years. Then the time will come when other projects surpass it. Imo the \"flippening\" will happen 100%, but I think it is still longer off than most people in here would like.\n\nAs to why ETH has more potential:\nThe aim to create not only a currency, but a platform for a complete economical system based on decentralized trust is amazing. Even though some aspects of it didn't work out in practice yet, things like DAOs, company ownership via tokens and governance projects are wild and new things that bring forth many promising projects/applications.\nIf anyone can make this work it is probably ethereum, because the project has a strong vision, unified developers and a good leading figure.\n\n\nSorry, my rant turned out longer than expected, I hope you found my opinion useful", 3], ["2017-10-22 03:59:22", "Personally I think it's a scam project.

Say, the price went up by 10 USD. You will have (roughly speaking, ignoring negligible fees) 5x3.3x10=165 USD profit, with which you can buy up to 0.78 eTH to increase your stack (while your own stack also increased in price by 10 USD per ETH). Total final ETH after this long position trade = 5.78 ETH. \n\nNow, imagine you expect the price to drop instead of rise. You can sell your original 5 ETH for USD (5ETH*~$200/ETH=~$1000), then borrow up to x3.3 of your collateral in ETH ($3300/($200 per ETH)=16.5 ETH) and sell those borrowed ETH at $200/ETH, getting $3300 and then rebuying ETH cheaper (17.37 ETH @$190/ETH) and giving back those 16.5 borrowed ETH and keep the rest 17.37-16.5=~0.87 ETH) to yourself. You also can rebuy your own stack cheaper ($1000/($190/ETH)=5.263 ETH) and now you have 1.13 ETH  (0.87+0.26) more.

Now imagine if you traded even one tenth of all price movements from $90 to $415 and then back down to $265 to $350 to $204 to $317 to $137 to $257 to $200 now.

If you have to ask yourself if you have ever been in a bear market then I assure you that you have not been in  a bear market. Bear markets go down day after day. They go down even when you have good news. Look at the chart of ethereum in the last qtr of 2016 that was a horrible bear market. If I recall without looking at a chart we went down to $7. the high was 21$ at that time. we went to a 1/3 of the value. That would be like $80 today. I'm not saying we are going into a bear market.

The other scenerio is banks adopt crypto or  a digital currency of there own. Now the problem  here is once your in crypto you don't have to keep it in a bank.  Banks keep less than 5% of actual money in the bank. So a bank would have to hold 100% or a run happens very quickly and feeds on it self. All of these scenerios create a big problem for banks and will force them to change dramatically or fail. Let me ask you!  If your money is in a bank and you have  a choice are you going to choose only paper money and  a journal entry or are you going to choose digital currency that you can move easily. What if the bank says well you can have digital currency but you cant move all your money only 10%.  Oh but we will pay you a few penny's to stay in paper money here. No the younger generation is going to say I want it in digital with the right to move it at any time. In fact why should I let the bank even hold it. I want full control of my money.

Everything written here is stuff to keep in mind when considering the viability, pros & cons of decentralized marketplace platforms. If you have interests in DNT, SWT, SYS, PART, SAFEX or any of the other platforms this is worth a read:\n\nThe original thread is here: -\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ETHInsider/comments/724e7d/monthly_rethinsider_altcoin_discussion_xrp_zec/dnjen3s/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ETHInsider/comments/724e7d/monthly_rethinsider_altcoin_discussion_xrp_zec/dnjux61/\n\n...\n\nThe reason syscoin and openBazaar haven't taken off yet is due to lack of anonymity, lack of privacy, diminished/impaired network effects, lack of incentives and issues in execution as described:\n\n**Pseudoanonymity:** \n\n- OpenBazaar uses BTC. \n\n- Syscoin: Can transact wth Zcash or BTC rather than public native sys token but uses human escrow (inefficient/trusted). Masternode incorporation introduces elements of centralization (although they aim to adopt RingCT in masternodes which could work well).\n\n**Native token status** \n\n- OpenBazaar has no native token so it cannot capitalize on the social and network effects of having a native token to speculate on.\n\n- Syscoin's native token not essential to use which mitigates a lot of the speculative upside to the token by creating routes to bypass the buy pressure on it. If syscoin forced all tx to occur in sys I'd be more bullish on it as a speculator as it's intrinsic value would be easier to increase.\n\n- Syscoin has an incredibly high coin supply; great if your aim is for liquidity on a globally adopted market but terrible if you're a speculator looking to profit from the trading of this coin as it potentially takes much larger daily trading volumes to move the spot price significantly. This is compounded by the sys token being non-native which means it suffers from a speculator viewpoint.\n\nSmaller supply coins with steady inflation rates are better by design as they allow for scalability in speculation and acknowledge a certain nicheness to their audience.\n\n**Network effects:**\n\n- OpenBazaar has been around for years but hasn't gained traction as no native token for speculators to promote platform on (buying/selling and diversification of tokenised ownership creates network effect).\n\n- Syscoin suffers from reduced network effects due to having a non-essential token with very large supply as described.\n\n**Audience:**\n\n- Most people don't know about Bitcoin; fewer about crypto. \n\n- Bitcoin is accepted at an increasing number of stores; a dedicated decentralized marketplace doesn't add value to the average end user so the incentive to use this isn't there. To this end OpenBazaar adds nothing new to the end-user experience.\n\n- Syscoin: As per OpenBazaar but audience needs to educate themselves on use of the sys token and distributed ledger technology in general. Currently not an anonymous/private network so no inherent advantage to trading compared to Amazon/eBay + disadvantages of needing to learn/understand technology to transact.\n\n**User Interface:**\n\n- Users have to learn/understand the technology of OB and Sys to transact without gaining any inherent advantages to purchasing via those systems.\n\n- The OB GUI is terrible (has improved though).\n\n- All platforms currently required dedicated client downloads to run.\n\n...\n\n**Privacy centric markets e.g. Particl (PART) are useful for:**\n\n- Privacy enthusiasts.\n\n- People who wish to live independent of fiat.\n\n- People who live in localities where crypto is not taxed or recognized as a legal unit of exchange (potentially legally bypassing local tax laws).\n\n- Grey market purchases (nootropics, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, alcohol, luxury goods, knockoff's (including unbranded device clones or items which are essentially legal but copyright may be an issue).\n\n- Embarrassing legal goods purchases or purchases you do not want appearing on a credit card statement (sex toys is an obvious one; I'm sure there are more)\n\n- People in countries with unstable economies (Venuezela, Zimbabwe) where local currency hyperinflation means purchasing various goods in native currency is pointless/expensive/cumbersome but using alternative non-private currencies to transact (e.g. Bitcoin) may result in prosecution.\n\n- Legal transaction of goods internationally but the need to keep location of buyer/sender publicly hidden due to local/regional restrictions or requirements for other bureaucracy if purchased in fiat\n\n- *Extremely sensitive* research and development or manufacturing projects especially product manufacture where for whatever reason the design, parts and manufacturing process must be completely unknown or obscurable. \n\n- Whole seller/boutique manufacturing and R&D is probably the biggest legal use case especially where patent's or highly sensitive data is concerned and for whole sellers and large scale manufacturers who wish to keep their trade secrets intact. \n\n- **Addition:** Provide a safe, secure competitive edge when negociating with multiple contractors. MAD Escrow service serves as a nice deposit feature for lock on of contracts for large scale distributors where trust or quality concerns may be an issue.\n\n- Sometimes the convenience associated with trading on a fully anonymous platform (where the client node locations are anon and the buyer/seller/amount are publicly anon) in terms of keeping paperwork and records but still trading goods for a fungible currency) outweighs the risks. Anyone who has ever had to do company accounts will understand what a pain in the ass these are to keep and produce.\n\n- Any transaction where only the buyer and seller can know about the nature of the transaction. This relates back to R&D, sensitive information exchange but is facilitated by PARTICL having a trustless, automated non-human escrow (the MAD mutually assured destruction escrow) to ensure both buyer and seller are complicit in ensuring delivery of payment and delivery of goods in acceptable condition.\n\n...\n\nI've discussed this with a friend who tinkers in making all kinds of *legal* useful gadgets (we're talking voice activated Iron Man suits with built in LCD screens, Thor Hammers and tonnes of custom cosplay stuff in amazing quality); he'd be reluctant to sell these on eBay due to litigation risks but he'd make a killing selling these anonymously online; these are definitely things people want and would enjoy. There's a tonne of stuff on alibaba which would be ideal to sell on the Particl network; true anonymity creates an incentive to justify many of the negatives I've outlined.\n\n...\n\n**Apologies** if I'm cluttering as I'm aware a fair chunk of ETHinsider reads ETHtraderpro as well but I do think the topic is highly relevant as I believe cryptocurrencies will flourish in the era of decentralized exchanges and marketplaces (espcially marketplaces that integrate DEX's) which will reinforce liquidity, bring non-speculative fiat into the ecosystem and strengthen it's independence from traditional fiat whilst being simultaneously bolstered by it.\n\n**Full disclosure:** I am long ETH, PART, REP, ICN, FCT, OMG, TRST.

Do you really care? In a nutshell: Tezos is souped up Ethereum. Tezos claims to fix governance issues and features formal verification of smart contracts. They don\u2019t want a DAOsaster happening on their watch.\n\nTezos, like Ethereum, will launch via an un-capped ICO. If you so desire, you can pledge all your hard earned Bitcoin and Ether for new and shinny Tezzies (XTZ). Tezzies are the tokens that are used natively on the Tezos protocol. They sound super cute, n\u2019est pas?\n\nBancor raised $152 million this month and surpassed the DAO as the largest crowdfunding project in human history. One of Tezos\u2019 esteemed advisors, Emin Gun Sirer, in a recent Hacking Distributed blog post, stopped short of calling Bancor an outright fraud. With ICO euphoria at an all-time high, Tezos could crush the record just set by Bancor. My target is $500 million.\n\nThe token generation event (TGE - repeat after me \u201cit is not a security\u201d), will take place over 2,000 Bitcoin blocks. That is approximately two weeks. Every fundraising milestone reached will be covered to death and will engage financial reporters, an element missing from past ICOs.\nDLS = Shadystan\n\nThe structure of Tezos is a little different that many ICOs you may be familiar with. Essentially the founders constructed a US entity, Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), that gets a payout if certain conditions are met. The Tezos foundation, who issues the tokens and receives the Bitcoin and Ether, is contractually obligated to pay DLS 8.5% of the proceeds and 10% of the tokens.\n\nA Swiss foundation raises hundreds of millions of dollars from retail investors globally, and then funnels a significant portion of the loot back into a US company. DLS owns all the Tezos IP, which the foundation essentially purchases with proceeds from the token sale. Ding Ding Ding, SEC please look over here. Not even a white-shoe law firm like Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz could wipe the stink off of this structure.\n\nIf the price of Tezzies performs badly in the secondary market, and / or the tech does not deliver as advertised, a hoard of grannies and grandpas have a nice juicy US entity to sue into oblivion.\n\nDLS also could face the wrath of an ambitious securities prosecutor. If I were a young Southern District of New York prosecutor, DLS is the perfect target for an opening salvo in the war on ICOs. Someone will get perp walked due to ICO events. Who better than a gaggle of Goldman and Bridgewater bankers to publicly tar and feather.\n\nThe Tezos founders are incentivised, through their DLS stake, to engineer a quick cash grab. The bigger the raise, the more immediate funds they receive through the 8.5% sale proceeds payout. The short-term incentives rub many potential investors the wrong way. \nRally Time\n\nEven in Shadystan, people will rush to purchase Bitcoin and Ether for the sole purpose of investing in Tezos. The Tezos Bitcoin and Ether vacuum will provide a strong bid for the funding currencies. During the DAO ICO, Ether rallied 40%.

Everything written here is stuff to keep in mind when considering the viability, pros & cons of decentralized marketplace platforms. If you have interests in DNT, SWT, SYS, PART, SAFEX or any of the other platforms this is worth a read:\n\nThe original thread is here: -\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ETHInsider/comments/724e7d/monthly_rethinsider_altcoin_discussion_xrp_zec/dnjen3s/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/ETHInsider/comments/724e7d/monthly_rethinsider_altcoin_discussion_xrp_zec/dnjux61/\n\n...\n\nThe reason syscoin and openBazaar haven't taken off yet is due to lack of anonymity, lack of privacy, diminished/impaired network effects, lack of incentives and issues in execution as described:\n\n**Pseudoanonymity:** \n\n- OpenBazaar uses BTC. \n\n- Syscoin: Can transact wth Zcash or BTC rather than public native sys token but uses human escrow (inefficient/trusted). Masternode incorporation introduces elements of centralization (although they aim to adopt RingCT in masternodes which could work well).\n\n**Native token status** \n\n- OpenBazaar has no native token so it cannot capitalize on the social and network effects of having a native token to speculate on.\n\n- Syscoin's native token not essential to use which mitigates a lot of the speculative upside to the token by creating routes to bypass the buy pressure on it. If syscoin forced all tx to occur in sys I'd be more bullish on it as a speculator as it's intrinsic value would be easier to increase.\n\n- Syscoin has an incredibly high coin supply; great if your aim is for liquidity on a globally adopted market but terrible if you're a speculator looking to profit from the trading of this coin as it potentially takes much larger daily trading volumes to move the spot price significantly. This is compounded by the sys token being non-native which means it suffers from a speculator viewpoint.\n\nSmaller supply coins with steady inflation rates are better by design as they allow for scalability in speculation and acknowledge a certain nicheness to their audience.\n\n**Network effects:**\n\n- OpenBazaar has been around for years but hasn't gained traction as no native token for speculators to promote platform on (buying/selling and diversification of tokenised ownership creates network effect).\n\n- Syscoin suffers from reduced network effects due to having a non-essential token with very large supply as described.\n\n**Audience:**\n\n- Most people don't know about Bitcoin; fewer about crypto. \n\n- Bitcoin is accepted at an increasing number of stores; a dedicated decentralized marketplace doesn't add value to the average end user so the incentive to use this isn't there. To this end OpenBazaar adds nothing new to the end-user experience.\n\n- Syscoin: As per OpenBazaar but audience needs to educate themselves on use of the sys token and distributed ledger technology in general. Currently not an anonymous/private network so no inherent advantage to trading compared to Amazon/eBay + disadvantages of needing to learn/understand technology to transact.\n\n**User Interface:**\n\n- Users have to learn/understand the technology of OB and Sys to transact without gaining any inherent advantages to purchasing via those systems.\n\n- The OB GUI is terrible (has improved though).\n\n- All platforms currently required dedicated client downloads to run.\n\n...\n\n**Privacy centric markets e.g. Particl (PART) are useful for:**\n\n- Privacy enthusiasts.\n\n- People who wish to live independent of fiat.\n\n- People who live in localities where crypto is not taxed or recognized as a legal unit of exchange (potentially legally bypassing local tax laws).\n\n- Grey market purchases (nootropics, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, alcohol, luxury goods, knockoff's (including unbranded device clones or items which are essentially legal but copyright may be an issue).\n\n- Embarrassing legal goods purchases or purchases you do not want appearing on a credit card statement (sex toys is an obvious one; I'm sure there are more)\n\n- People in countries with unstable economies (Venuezela, Zimbabwe) where local currency hyperinflation means purchasing various goods in native currency is pointless/expensive/cumbersome but using alternative non-private currencies to transact (e.g. Bitcoin) may result in prosecution.\n\n- Legal transaction of goods internationally but the need to keep location of buyer/sender publicly hidden due to local/regional restrictions or requirements for other bureaucracy if purchased in fiat\n\n- *Extremely sensitive* research and development or manufacturing projects especially product manufacture where for whatever reason the design, parts and manufacturing process must be completely unknown or obscurable. \n\n- Whole seller/boutique manufacturing and R&D is probably the biggest legal use case especially where patent's or highly sensitive data is concerned and for whole sellers and large scale manufacturers who wish to keep their trade secrets intact. \n\n- **Addition:** Provide a safe, secure competitive edge when negociating with multiple contractors. MAD Escrow service serves as a nice deposit feature for lock on of contracts for large scale distributors where trust or quality concerns may be an issue.\n\n- Sometimes the convenience associated with trading on a fully anonymous platform (where the client node locations are anon and the buyer/seller/amount are publicly anon) in terms of keeping paperwork and records but still trading goods for a fungible currency) outweighs the risks. Anyone who has ever had to do company accounts will understand what a pain in the ass these are to keep and produce.\n\n- Any transaction where only the buyer and seller can know about the nature of the transaction. This relates back to R&D, sensitive information exchange but is facilitated by PARTICL having a trustless, automated non-human escrow (the MAD mutually assured destruction escrow) to ensure both buyer and seller are complicit in ensuring delivery of payment and delivery of goods in acceptable condition.\n\n...\n\nI've discussed this with a friend who tinkers in making all kinds of *legal* useful gadgets (we're talking voice activated Iron Man suits with built in LCD screens, Thor Hammers and tonnes of custom cosplay stuff in amazing quality); he'd be reluctant to sell these on eBay due to litigation risks but he'd make a killing selling these anonymously online; these are definitely things people want and would enjoy. There's a tonne of stuff on alibaba which would be ideal to sell on the Particl network; true anonymity creates an incentive to justify many of the negatives I've outlined.\n\n...\n\n**Apologies** if I'm cluttering as I'm aware a fair chunk of ETHinsider reads ETHtraderpro as well but I do think the topic is highly relevant as I believe cryptocurrencies will flourish in the era of decentralized exchanges and marketplaces (espcially marketplaces that integrate DEX's) which will reinforce liquidity, bring non-speculative fiat into the ecosystem and strengthen it's independence from traditional fiat whilst being simultaneously bolstered by it.\n\n**Full disclosure:** I am long ETH, PART, REP, ICN, FCT, OMG, TRST.

Yes, I think this will revolutionize worldwide commerce just like the Internet did in the 2000s. Yes, I also think right now is like the Internet in 1994.

If history repeats itself why would you invest 80% of your ETF in companies that probably won't be around in 15 years?\n\n- Finally, I don't know these guys experience with crypto but it doesn't seem to me that they necessarily know how to evaluate blockchain applications and commodities (coins).

Opening a bank account isn't really a problem, as long as you're persistent enough you don't even need to be living in the country long-term. There aren't really any hard and fast rules, depending on the bank and the teller you're talking to on any given day, they may ask you different questions and require different documents to open a basic debit account. If you have a medium to long term accommodation in Korea (like a 6+ month rental or whatever), it is trivial to open an account with some of the more expat-friendly banks such as Hana or Woori bank. \n\nNow the fun part. As of today, there are NO regulations of any kind whatsoever pertaining to crypto currencies in Korea. It is in no way illegal or anything; as far as Korean law is concerned, crypto currency basically doesn't exist. Crypto trading isn't even taxed, not even capital gains tax on profits or anything. you could sell 100 million worth of BTC and you'd get to keep all of it.\n\nFor the less fun part, just like the other poster said, cash flow out of the country is limited to 50,000$ unless you can provide 'proper financial records' detailing where the money came from, and where is it going to. And since crypto currencies do not exist in the eyes of the law, saying you made 100,000$ selling Ethereum doesn't hold up as proof of incomes sufficient to lift the 50,000$ outgoings restriction. \n\nThere are several semi-legal and decidedly illegal ways around it; you could ask friends or family members to send money out for you (fairly legal), you could pay a hobo for his citizenship number to open a bank account in his name and use it yourself (not legal at all), you could lie about immigrating from the country and taking your long time savings with you to buy a house abroad or somesuch (not sure if that would fly, also questionable from the legal point of view), or you could fly in and out of the country with 9,999$ in cash on you (under 10k doesn't need to be declared) to Taiwan or Japan or something -- probably not illegal, but could raise questions from immigration after some time, and a pain in the ass to do anyway. \n\nSo, it's possible to make 'some' profits doing a little bit of arbitraging, especially if Koreans decide to go crazy with a 50% markup as we've seen a few days ago again, but not something you can count on doing long term. Also, Korean government is supposedly working on implementing proper crypto trading regulations 'sometime this summer' (rumored), at that point I guess you'll be able to declare that income for outgoing transactions and prices will level out with Western somewhat. \n\nHope the wall of text is helpful, feel free to ask me if you have any more specific questions on this; I've done a lot of legwork on the subject.", 5], ["2017-05-28 23:02:11", "Won't be easy to arbitrage trade.

The questions about my stay I could bullshit whatever, none of the answers were tested in any way. At Woori bank's Gangnam branch they were a little more skeptical about letting me open a bank account without an ARC, however a copy of my rental agreement + proof of funds that I would supposedly put into that bank account was enough (I never did actually transfer the money there, simply showing them I have 5k+ USD somewhere else worked). \n\nIf for whatever reason they refuse to open an account for you, you can always try your luck in another branch and / or on another day; I think your chances depend heavily on which country you're from, though.
